4,ash,646,ASH,The incombustible matter remaining after a substance has been incinerated.,"##### Illustrative Context\n_There was nothing left but **ash**._\n\n##### Disambiguation\nBeware the ambiguity of English _ash_.  The meaning here is _ash_ as the remains of burnt materials, **not** the tree species _ash_.\n\n##### Target Sense\n* Ash as the generic word for the powdery remains from burning many materials, such as wood, grass or dry dung.\n* The lexeme must be applicable to **cold** ash.  Avoid words that refer specifically to still hot _embers_.\n* The lexeme must be applicable to ash as reduced to **powder**.  Avoid words that can refer to material not fully burnt and still solid, objects that are merely charred or blackened.\n* The lexeme must be applicable to ash that is **white/grey** in colour, and not just charred black _soot_. \n* The generic term for the **substance**.  In many languages this will be a mass/non-count noun, as in English ‘singular’ _ash_ or French _(la) cendre_.  In such cases, provide this mass or ‘singular’ form, especially if plural forms have more specific senses, such as _ash**es**_ or _(les) cendre**s**_ — see the next bullet point.\n* Avoid words with the specific sense of the burnt remains of a particular thing, or indeed a body, and/or the results of a deliberate act of cremation, e.g. Russian _прах_ or the usage of the plural _ash**es**_ in English.\n* Distinguish from, and see also the definitions for the distinct IE-CoR meanings [dust](../wiki/Meaning:-dust) and [sand](../wiki/Meaning:-sand).\n "
6,back,1291,BACK,"The rear of body, especially the part between the neck and the end of the spine and opposite the chest and belly.","#### Illustrative Context\n_I fell over and now my **back** hurts._\n\n#### Disambiguation\nBeware the polysemy of English _back_.  The meaning intended here is the noun for the **part of the human body**, not the reverse side of an object, nor the adverb as in _go back_, _put it back_.\n\n#### Target Sense\n* The most generic term for the ‘back’ as a part of the human body.  \n* The term should be able to refer to the whole back, from the shoulders to the hips. \n* In many languages, such as English, the lexeme in this target sense (_back_) can also be applied more widely, e.g. on _horseback_ or the _back of the house_.  In such languages, this remains the correct lexeme to select, since it is also the basic term for the target sense.  \n* Avoid, however, terms that refer _specifically_ to the ‘back’ of an animal or the reverse side of an object, if different from the basic word for the human back.\n* Avoid terms specific to the sense of the weight-bearing part of the body for carrying.  In particular, avoid terms that mean specifically _shoulders_. \n* Avoid narrower terms specific to only one part of the back, e.g. equivalent either to English _upper back_ or _lower back_ only.\n* If a language has two distinct lexemes for the upper vs. lower back specifically, but no generic lexeme applicable to the whole back, then select the term considered the more basic and commoner of the two.  Only if no such judgement seems justifiable, then select the term for the upper back."
7,bad,1292,BAD,Not good; unfavorable; negative.,"#### Illustrative Context\n_That isn’t a good idea, it’s a **bad** idea._\n\n#### Target Sense\n* The most generic, default, unmarked adjective for negative judgement, as an antonym of [good](/wiki/Meaning:-good).  \n* The target sense is a general judgement of negative, i.e. deleterious or inappropriate in the current context.  \nBeware the wide polysemy of the English word _bad_.  \n* Avoid terms specific to the sense of _morally_ wrong or _evil_.  There is no necessary implication of this in the IE-CoR target sense of ‘bad’.\n* Avoid terms for other specific sub-senses of English ‘bad’, e.g. words that mean specifically ‘rotten’, ‘angry’, etc.. \n* Avoid marked, intensifying words, such as _terrible_, _horrible_.\n* Some languages may not have a straightforward candidate lexeme for this target sense.  In such cases, as well as the illustrative context given above, consider also which term for ‘bad’ works well in a wider variety of usage contexts. \n* Occasional languages (e.g. Cuzco Quechua) may even lack a default generic adjective for ‘bad’, and instead use just a negation of their lexeme for ‘good’.  It is possible to enter this ‘not good’ combination as the lexeme for this meaning, but only in languages where there is no viable simple adjective for negative judgement."
8,bark,1204,BARK,The exterior covering of the trunk and branches of a tree.,"##### Illustrative Context\n_He tore some **bark** off the tree._\n\n##### Disambiguation\nThe noun for the bark (outer layer) of a tree, **not** the verb (or noun) for the sound made by a dog!\n\n##### Target Sense\n* The most basic, generic term for the outermost layer(s) of the trunk and branches of a tree or shrub, often relatively easily stripped off. \n* Avoid technical terms from botany.  Base your lexeme determination on common usage, not on botanical nomenclature\nand classification.  Select the most basic, generic term that includes the outermost layer, even if that popular usage may also include other immediately underlying layers as strictly defined in botany.  \n* Avoid terms that mean specifically _cork_ — technically only part of the bark, and not the outermost layer — or any other sub-layer.\n* Avoid terms specific to particular uses of bark, or parts of it, e.g. _cork_.\n* Avoid terms specific to particular types of bark, or the bark of particular types of tree.\n\n\n"
10,belly,1251,BELLY,"The lower part of the front of the torso (or a comparable part of an animal), confined by the upper side by the midriff and the lowerside by the pelvis. Contains the intestines.","#### Illustrative Context\n_He punched him in the **belly**._\n\n#### Target Sense\nThe front part of the human body below the rib-cage/chest and above the pelvis.\n\n* Avoid more loaded terms with specific overtones, such as size or protrusion, e.g. _paunch_, _pot belly_.\n* Avoid higher register terms, e.g. scientific or medical terms such as _abdomen_.\n* Avoid nursery-register terms such as _tummy_.\n* Avoid terms *specific* to internal organs.  Only in cases where a lexeme that originally referred to an internal organ has since extended semantically to become the default register word also (ambiguously) for the target sense here, would that lexeme be the correct selection.  An example is that in some varieties of English, _stomach_ has indeed now become the (ambiguous) default term for this meaning.\n "
11,big,1202,BIG,Of a great size.,"##### Illustrative Context\n_This is a **big** stone. That is a small stone._\n\n##### Target Sense\n* The most generic term, typically adjectival, for large size in an unspecified dimension.  The basic, default antonym of [small](/wiki/Meaning:-small).  \n* The basic term will generally be applicable very widely, but must be applicable at least to inanimate objects.  Avoid terms used only or predominantly to refer to people.\n* Avoid terms specific to a particular dimension like height, width or girth:  i.e. avoid terms such as _tall_, _wide_ or _fat_.  \n* Avoid intensifying terms that stress especially big, e.g. _huge_, _vast_, _enormous_.\n* Enter the most basic, neutral term.  Avoid lexemes with any inherent value judgement of any form, e.g. _great_, _grand_.\n* See also the definition for the IE-CoR meaning [small](../wiki/Meaning:-small).  \n"
12,bird,937,BIRD,"Any of the bipedal, warm-blooded vertebrates that lay eggs having wings which, for most species, enables them to fly.","#### Illustrative Context\n_What **bird** does this feather come from?_\n\n#### Target Sense\n* The most basic, generic term to refer to birds.  \n* The generic lexeme selected must be able to refer to a flighted bird of medium size, for example a common (Eurasian) blackbird — but obviously must not be the specific name of that or any other individual bird species.\n* In languages that have no single generic term, but separate terms by size, select the term for birds of that medium (blackbird) size.  \n* Avoid terms _specific_ to particularly small or particularly large species of bird.\n* Avoid terms specific to particular types of bird, such as birds of prey, e.g. _raptor_.  \n* Avoid terms specific to domesticated or hunted birds, e.g. _fowl_.\n* Avoid technical, biological terminology, e.g. _avian_.\n"
13,bite,1403,BITE,Clamping the teeth hard on something.,"##### Illustrative Context\n_The dog **bit** him._\n\n##### Target Sense\n* Most generic transitive verb for biting with the teeth, avoiding any terms with more limited and specific senses.\n* Avoid terms specific to the ‘bite’ (or sting) of insects, snakes, etc..\n* Avoid terms for prolonged, repeated biting or masticating with the teeth, e.g. _gnaw_, _chew_, _chomp_, etc..\n* Avoid terms that imply _continuing_ to grasp or hold on to with the teeth.\n* Avoid terms specifically meaning to cut or tear away with the teeth, i.e. _bite **off**_.\n* Avoid terms with any other narrower senses or usage, e.g. specifically for biting food, or indeed for biting people.\n\n"
14,black,163,BLACK,Dark and colourless; not reflecting visible light.,"#### Illustrative Context\n_Charcoal is **black**._\n\n#### Target Sense\n* The most basic colour term (usually adjectival) seen as the natural antonym of [white](../wiki/Meaning:-white).\n* Avoid terms meaning _dark_ (absence of (day)light), _dirty_ or _burnt_.\n* Avoid terms limited to figurative senses such as _bleak_, _depressing_.\n* Give only the most basic colour term:  avoid near-synonymous terms based on specific things (especially nouns!) that are prototypically black in colour:  e.g. _soot_, ebony_, _jet_.\n* Avoid intensifying terms or compounds used to stress _totally_ or _completely_ black, e.g. _pitch black_. "
15,blood,946,BLOOD,A fluid connective tissue consisting of the plasma and cells that circulate in the blood vessels.,"##### Illustrative Context\n_**Blood** is red._\n\n##### Target Sense\n* The most generic term for blood, which must be able to be applied specifically to human blood as running fresh from a cut to the skin.  (In most languages the basic generic term will also be applicable to the blood of many animals.) \n* Select only the basic, default register term:  avoid technical, medical terms.\n* Avoid loaded or emotive terms, e.g. English _gore_ or Latin _cruor_ rather than basic _sanguis_.\n* Avoid words only or predominantly used in figurative senses of ‘blood’ as ancestry, offspring, vigour, etc..\n* Avoid more specific terms for types of blood, e.g. dried blood (e.g. as a food), etc.\n* If a language has no cover term, but has separate terms for lighter red (arterial) and darker red (vein) blood, then select whichever is the more basic, and only if that cannot be determined, select specifically the term for lighter red, arterial blood.\n"
17,bone,1394,BONE,"Any of the components of an endoskeleton, consisting mainly of calcium phosphate, collagen and cells.","##### Illustrative Context\n_He fell and broke a **bone**._\n\n##### Target Sense\n* Most generic term, and which must be applicable to bones of the human body.\n* In many languages, the generic term will be widely applicable to the bones of animals, too.  Avoid, however, terms specific to certain animals or fish, e.g. French _arête_ (fishbone).\n* Avoid terms specific to ‘bone’ as a substance, e.g. of which things can be made.  The term must be applicable to an actual bone, e.g. in a skeleton.\n* Avoid any more limited terms that are specific only to certain types of bone (e.g. _antlers_), or to certain uses (e.g. for food), and so on. \n\n\n"
18,chest,1592,CHEST,The portion of the body from the base of the neck to the top of the abdomen; the thorax.,"##### Illustrative Context\n_His wore a medal on his **chest**._\n\n##### Target Sense\n* The part of the human body between the shoulders and the diaphragm/upper belly (as seen from the front side, but also referring to within the rib-cage, not just in front of it — see below).  \n* Effectively this corresponds to the thorax in medical terminology, but following IE-CoR policy, certainly do not select such technical medical terms. Follow the basic, default register instead, i.e. English _chest_, definitely not _thorax_.\n* Provide the general term for this part of the body, that can be applied to both males and females, both children and adults. Certainly do not select a lexeme that refers only, or predominantly, to the female breasts.  The English lexeme for this target sense is therefore _chest_ (not _breast_ — see also below), in French _poitrine_ (not _sein_), and in Spanish _pecho_ (not _seno_).  Only if a language has no common term, select the word for _male_ chest.  \n* Also avoid figurative uses, senses such as English _bosom_, and euphemistic ones.\n* The term selected should be general _also_ in being able to refer to the part of the body _within_ the rib cage, not just in front of it.  Again, _breast_ is thus not the right lexeme in English, since it refers primarily to the part of the body _in front_ of the rib cage, whereas the correct _chest_ can indeed refer to inside the rib cage too, as in _a chest infection_. Likewise in French, the correct word _poitrine_ is used in, for example, _angine de poitrine_. \n* The need for a general term also means that lexemes that apply only to inside the ribs, such as _rib cage_ or _lungs_, are also to be avoided. \n* Do not be confused by the potential ambiguities in English, which has both a common _chest_ word, as well as another term _breast_. They are only part-synonmous, in that _breast_ can be applied to males or females, but is also ambiguous, because in context it can also have the specific sense of the female breast, and indeed can be used in the plural. Modern usage is tending towards _chest_ as the more general term. In this general sense, _breast_ is becoming dated for many speakers.  It remains in some fixed collocations (e.g. _breast stroke_ in swimming), but otherwise is increasingly reserved as specific to females. (It would sound odd to say _he was punched in the breast_, for example. And while both sexes can suffer _chest pain_, the expression _breast pain_ would normally be taken as referring to a woman only.)\n\n\n"
19,breathe,1407,BREATHE,"To repeatedly draw air into, and expel it from, the lungs, in order to extract oxygen from it and excrete waste products.","#### Illustrative Context\n_People can't **breathe** underwater._\n\n#### Target Sense\n* Most generic term, typically verbal, covering both breathing in and out together, as a cycle.\n* Avoid terms that mean specifically breathing _in_ or _out_ — unless one of those terms doubles up as also the generic, unmarked term for the whole cycle of breathing. \n* Only if a language (unusually) has no single term that covers both breathing in and out, then select whichever of those two terms is the most basic and general.  Only if that cannot be distinguished, then select the term for breathing _in_.\n\n"
20,burn,2102,BURN,To put fire on something or to be on fire.,"#### Illustrative Context\n_The wood is **burning** in the fire._\n\n#### Target Sense\n* The most generic, neutral **intransitive** verb for the process of combustion of material, the process that changes an object like wood from its natural state into ashes.  \n* In many languages this will correspond to a middle voice or reflexive:  e.g. Spanish _quemarse_.  \n\n* [Avoid intensifying terms](https://github.com/lingdb/CoBL-public/wiki/01--Policy-on-Selecting-Lexemes#unmarked--neither-intensive-nor-attenuating) for burning especially strongly or brightly:  e.g. _blaze_, Spanish _arder_.  \n\n* [Avoid figurative terms](https://github.com/lingdb/CoBL-public/wiki/01--Policy-on-Selecting-Lexemes#unmarked--literal-not-figurative-or-emotive) for 'burning' with emotion, desire, anger etc.:  e.g. Spanish _arder_.  \n\n* Avoid non-neutral terms for burning seen as dangerous and undesirable:  e.g. _be on fire_.  \n\n* Avoid terms that explicitly stress completeness and/or destruction:  e.g. _burn up_, _burn down_.  \n\n* Avoid inchoatives or causatives:  e.g. _catch fire_, _set on fire_, _light_.  \n\n* [Avoid technical and scientific terms](https://github.com/lingdb/CoBL-public/wiki/01--Policy-on-Selecting-Lexemes#unmarked-default-register-of-everyday-speech):  e.g. _combust_.  \n\n\n"
22,cloud,1489,CLOUD,Suspensions of minute water droplets or ice crystals produced by the condensation of water vapour.,"##### Illustrative Context\n_There were white **clouds** in the blue sky._ \n\n##### Target Sense\n* The most generic term for a (white) cloud, in the sky.\n* Avoid terms for ‘cloud’ at ground level, if different, e.g. _fog_, _mist_.\n* Avoid terms specific to particular types of cloud:  _raincloud, _dark cloud_, _thunder cloud_.\n* Avoid technical, meteorological terms.\n"
23,cold,1287,COLD,Having a low temperature.,"##### Illustrative Context\n_The rocks get hot during the day and **cold** at night._  \n\n##### Target Sense\n* The default antonym of [hot](../wiki/Meaning:-hot). \n* The most basic term, typically adjectival, that covers the **largest span** of temperatures lower than neutral, and the **middle ground** of that span of temperatures (within sensible bounds of the usual temperature range in human experience).  \n* This should be a generic, relative term, not a specific and absolute one such as _ice cold_, _freezing cold_.\n* Avoid marked, loaded, judgement terms for excessively cold, or not cold enough.\n* Aim for the term covering the broadest range of tactile, ambient and personal uses.\n* Avoid narrow terms limited to specific uses, e.g. cold only of food, only of liquids, only of weather, and so on.\n* Avoid resultative or change of state terms for _made cold_, _cooled_, _chilled_.\n* Select the default, unmarked term, i.e. avoid both intensifying terms for particularly cold, ‘freezing’;  and qualifying, weakening terms such as (only) _cool_. \n\n##### References\n* On the contrasts of ambient vs. tactile in languages of Vanuatu (François 2015), and in Japanese.  \n* On the contrasts of tactile vs. ambient vs. personal (Koptjeskaja-Tamm 2011).\n* On the contrasts between terms for things which _are_ cold, and which _have become_ cold, i.e. ‘cooled down’ (Bowern and Kling 2015). "
24,come,1446,COME,"To move toward or to reach either the speaker, the person spoken to, or the subject of the speaker's narrative.","##### Illustrative Context\n_I saw him on the road. I don’t know where he was **coming** from._\n\n##### Target Sense\n* The most generic intransitive verb for moving towards a deictic point of reference.  The term selected must be able to refer to humans walking, but should not be specific to only that case.\n* Avoid terms limited to particular ways of moving, e.g. on foot, riding an animal, or by transport.  Some languages do have several distinct verbs for ‘come’ for particular ways of moving.  Only if none of these can serve as an unmarked cover term for ‘come’, applicable to any way of moving, select the lexeme for humans walking.\n* Avoid terms for moving in general but which do not specify the deictic directionality of ‘come’.\n* Avoid terms specifically with inchoative meaning, e.g. _set off for_.\n* Avoid terms specific to coming _from_ a place, including usage referring to a home territory where one is originally from.\n* See also the definition for the IE-CoR meaning [go](../wiki/Meaning:-go).\n"
25,count,1420,COUNT,To determine the amount of something or to enumerate the digits of one's numeral system.,"##### Illustrative Context\n_I **counted** the stones; there were five stones._\n\n##### Target Sense\n* The most generic transitive verb for counting (up) objects.  \n* This term should be applicable (as in the illustrative context) to the act of **counting up** objects one by one, starting from one and stepping up to the total.\n* Avoid terms for more complex calculating, reckoning, or working out by some form of mathematical procedure, beyond simply counting up one by one.  E.g. in German the target lexeme is _zählen_, not _rechnen_.  \n* Select the basic term for counting actual things in concrete cases — i.e. avoid terms specifically for reciting a numeral sequence in the abstract.\n* Avoid technical and mathematical terms like _enumerate_.\n\n\n"
27,day,1225,DAY (NOT NIGHT),The period between sunrise and sunset where one enjoys daylight.,"##### Illustrative Context\n_**Day** and night._\n\n##### Target Sense\n* The most generic term for day as the basic antonym of [night](../wiki/Meaning:-night).\n* In many languages, like English, the same basic term can also refer to the whole 24-hour period, the cycle of both day and night.  Avoid, however, terms that refer exclusively to the 24-hour period, and are not also the basic term for _day_ as opposed to night.  \n* The term for the period of time alternating with night, not just for _(day)light_ or _bright(ness)_ in general.\n"
28,die,1494,DIE,To cease to live.,"##### Illustrative Context\n_Everyone **dies** sooner or later._\n\n##### Target Sense\n* The most generic verb for the death of people, non-specific as to cause.  \n* The lexeme selected must be applicable to humans, although in many languages will also serve for animals and plants. \n* Avoid terms specifically for dying ‘of old age’, or specific to any other cause. \n* The most neutral register, literal term.  Avoid lexemes that are emotionally charged (e.g. _perish_), euphemistic or polite (e.g. _pass (away)_), literary (e.g. _expire_) or slang (e.g. _kick the bucket_).  \n* The basic term in a language may of course have originated in some such register, but since lost those connotations and become simply the normal default term for ‘die’.  If so, then it is indeed now the lexeme in the IE-CoR target sense, and should be selected. \n* Avoid terms with specific connotations of violent death.\n* See also the target specifications for the separate IE-CoR meanings [kill](../wiki/Meaning:-kill) and [live](../wiki/Meaning:-live).\n"
29,dig,1418,DIG,"To move earth, rocks, etc. out of the way, usually to create a hole.","##### Illustrative Context\n_He is **digging** in the ground._\n\n##### Target Sense\n* The most generic verb for digging (by people), typically to create a hole, by removing earth, soil, sand, etc..\n* Prototypically an intransitive verb for the general activity of digging.  In a language where the basic verb is only transitive, then the object should be the _hole_ dug, not an object uncovered by digging.\n* Avoid terms specific to the (transitive) sense of uncovering _something_ buried underground (whether coming across it by chance or intentionally searching for it), i.e. digging _for_ something, or digging something _up_ or _out_.\n* Also avoid terms specific to digging a hole in order to bury something, including verbs specific to digging a grave for a body.  Indeed, obviously avoid verbs for _bury_, that include the sense of filling back in and covering up whatever is placed in the hole dug.\n* Avoid terms specific to digging with a certain instrument, e.g. _shovelling_.\n* Avoid technical or high-register terms, e.g. _excavate_.\n"
30,dirty,1230,DIRTY,Covered with or containing unpleasant substances such as dirt or grime.,"##### Illustrative Context\n_This cup is clean and that one is **dirty**._\n\n##### Target Sense\n* The most generic term, typically adjectival, as the antonym of _clean_.  \n* The target is the literal sense of ‘dirty’, of an object.  Avoid terms that are primarily figurative, e.g. for morally _impure_, _unfair_, _treacherous_.\n* The target sense is visual, prototypically referring to a surface to which other materials have become applied.  Avoid terms that have specific connotations of unpleasantness or smell. \n* The most neutral-register term.  Avoid euphemistic terms (e.g. _soiled_) or slang (e.g. _mucky_).\n* Avoid intensifying or (negative) judgement terms, such as _filthy_, _foul_.\n* Avoid overly specific terms that identify particular types of substance that cause the dirtiness:  e.g. _dusty_, _muddy_, _soiled_, _greasy_, _rusty_, etc..\n* Avoid terms specific to a particular form of dirtiness:  e.g. _stained_, _soiled_, _discoloured_.\n* Avoid vaguer terms for simply _black_, _dark_, etc..\n\n"
31,dog,2009,DOG,"A common four-legged animal, especially kept by people as a pet or to hunt or guard things.","##### Illustrative Context\n_I’d like to own a **dog**._\n\n##### Target Sense\n* The most generic term for a domesticated dog (_canis familiaris_).  Must **not** be the name of any particular breed(s) of dog.  \n* Avoid terms limited to particular types of dog, bred for particular purposes, e.g. English _hound_ as a hunting or racing dog.\n* Avoid words specific to dogs of particular ages or sexes, e.g. _puppy_, _bitch_, etc.. \n* The default register term:  avoid slang terms (e.g. _mut_) and technical, biological terms (_canine_).\n* The most neutral term:  avoid loaded, judgement terms that bear specific connotations, such as affection (e.g. _doggie_, _pooch_), pejoration (_mut_) or danger (_mastiff_, _cur_)."
32,drink,1401,DRINK,To consume a liquid through the mouth.,"##### Illustrative Context\n_He **drank** because he was thirsty._\n\n##### Disambiguation\nThe **verb** _(to) drink_, not the noun _(a) drink_.  The generic term, without any specific reference to alcohol.  \n\n##### Target Sense\n* The most generic verb for drinking, prototypically of people drinking water.  The lexeme selected must be able to be used in that context, although will normally have much wider applicability too to animals drinking, and to all liquids that can be drunk.\n* Avoid terms specific to particular ways of drinking, e.g. _sip_, _sup_, _suck_, _lap_.\n* Avoid intensifying terms for drinking fast or in large amounts, e.g. _guzzle_, _down_.\n* Avoid terms specific to social or cultural contexts, e.g. ritual drinking.\n* Avoid terms specific to drinking _alcoholic_ drinks, or with the intention or result being getting drunk.\n"
33,dry,1398,DRY,(Almost) free from liquid or moisture.,"##### Illustrative Context\n_Is it **dry** or wet?_\n\n##### Target Sense\n* The most generic adjective as an antonym of [wet](../wiki/Meaning:-wet).\n* Avoid terms specific to only an outer surface:  the lexeme selected should be a generic one that can also refer to lack of water or moisture throughout a material.\n* A neutral term, without judgement or connotations of dryness as positive or negative (e.g. _arid_) in any given case.\n* Avoid intensifying terms for extremely or excessively dry, e.g. _parched_.\n* Avoid terms specific to dry earth or land, e.g. _arid_. \n* Avoid any other more specialised terms, e.g. _desiccated_.\n* Avoid terms that specifically indicate a change of state, e.g. _dried (up)_, _dried out_, _desiccated_.\n* Avoid terms specific to figurative uses, e.g. dry of humour, drinks, etc.."
35,dust,2,DUST,Any kind of solid material divided in particles of very small size.,"##### Illustrative Context\n_When the ground is dry, you kick up **dust** when you walk._\n\n##### Target Sense\n* The most generic noun for dust.  Must be able to refer to the dust kicked up from dry earth, as in the illustrative context.  \n* In most languages the generic term will also be applicable more widely, including to the dust that gathers over time on surfaces within buildings.  Do not, however, select a term specific only to such dust within buildings.\n* Avoid terms that specifically mean _ash_.  Only if a language has a single basic term that covers both _ash_ and _dust_ (e.g. Hittite, Ancient Greek, Old Irish) should the same lexeme be selected both here for ‘dust’ and for the distinct IE-CoR meaning [ash](../wiki/Meaning:-ash).  Likewise for the distinct IE-CoR meaning [sand](../wiki/Meaning:-sand)."
36,ear,1247,EAR,"The organ of hearing, consisting of the pinna, auditory canal, eardrum, malleus, incus, stapes and cochlea.","#### Illustrative Context\n_One of his **ears** is bigger than the other **ear**_. \n\n#### Target Sense\n* The basic, default term for the human ear.  \n* The generic term in most languages will also be applicable to the ears of animals, but do not select a term that can be applied only to animals.  The lexeme selected must be the basic word for the human ear.\n* The default sense is the physical one, referring to the part of the body, not the functional sense of the organ for the sense of hearing.\n* Avoid terms specifically for the inner ear.  The lexeme selected must be able to refer to the part of the ear visible outside the skull, whether or not its reference can extend to the inner ear.  \n* Avoid terms used primarily to refer not to the anatomical, visible ear, but to figurative senses of listening, attentiveness, or hearing.\n* Give the singular form, avoiding special dual/plural formations.\n* Neutral, default register:  avoid technical, medical terms, and slang or jocular terms, e.g. _lug_.\n\n"
37,earth,1228,EARTH (SOIL),The soft and loose material forming a great part of the Earth surface.,"##### Illustrative Context \n_As he dug the hole, he threw out the **earth**._\n\n##### Target Sense\n\n* The most generic term for the loose material that covers a land surface — **not** the planet, the _world_.\n* In many languages this _may_ be the same term as for the _planet_ ‘earth’ (as in English), in which case this generic term will be suitable.  But avoid terms that are specific to the sense of the planet.  So for example in French _monde_ is wrong, and _terre_ is correct for the target sense.\n* In many languages this will be the same term as used in the traditional Classical concept of the four ‘elements’, i.e. _earth_ as opposed to _air_, _fire_ and _water_.\n* Avoid terms specifically for _cultivated_ earth to plant in, e.g. _soil_.\n* Avoid narrower terms for specific types of earth, e.g. sandy, silty or clayey soils.\n* Avoid terms specifically for _land_, _country_, _countryside_, etc..\n\n\n**Note:**  This IE-CoR target sense is significantly different to the ‘earth’ meaning as intended in versions of the Swadesh basic vocabulary lists.\n\n_See the IE-CoR language entries for this meaning on the [website](https://iecor.clld.org/parameters/37) or [data entry system](https://cobl.info/meaning/earth)._\n\n"
38,eat,1336,EAT,To consume something solid or semi-solid (usually food) by putting it into the mouth and eventually swallowing it.,"##### Illustrative Context\n_**Eat** some food and drink some water._\n\n##### Target Sense\n* The most generic verb for eating, prototypically of people eating a basic, traditional foodstuff.  The lexeme selected must be able to be used in that context, although will normally have much wider applicability too, to animals eating, and to most or all other foods.\n* The default register term:  avoid polite or euphemistic words (e.g. English _dine_, German _speisen_, Russian _кушать_), slang (e.g. French _bouffer_), nursery words (e.g. _munch_), etc..\n* The general sense of taking food into the body, without focusing on any particular way of eating or muscular action in the mouth, i.e. avoid specific terms like _chew_, _nibble_, _swallow_, etc..  (Note that language change can alter the specificity of such words.  The Latin word _manducare_ originally meant ‘chew’, and thus is not the IE-CoR lexeme for ‘eat’ in Classical Latin. Nonetheless, that word root has since given rise to Italian _mangiare_ and French _manger_.  These no longer bear any of the original connotation of specifically ‘chew’, and have become the default, unmarked lexemes for the IE-CoR meaning ‘eat’ in these languages.)\n* Avoid intensifying verbs, e.g. _eat up_, _devour_.\n* If a language has different default words used with different types of food (e.g. meat, cereals, fruits/nuts, hard food, soft food, liquid food, etc.), then select the most generic word.  If no term can be identified as more generic than others, select the verb used for eating the most basic, traditional foodstuff for most speakers of that language:  e.g. rice, bread, maize, etc., as appropriate.  This should therefore also be the most statistically frequent ‘eat’ verb in that language. \n* The literal sense of eating, i.e. avoid figurative senses of things being _eaten away (at)_, gradually losing mass or emotionally undermined by. \n\n"
39,egg,744,EGG,"Egg (either fertilized or not) from domesticated birds, most commonly hens, seen as food.","##### Illustrative Context\n_Don't drop the **egg**; it’ll break!_\n\n##### Target Sense\n* The most generic noun for the egg of a bird.\n* Must be able to refer to the prototypical sense of an egg with a hard outer shell, generally light in colour, and of medium size, such as the egg laid by a duck or a hen.  \n* In many languages the lexeme selected may be more widely applicable, including to reptiles, but do not select terms specific to the eggs of reptiles. \n* Similarly, the term selected may be applicable also to soft ‘eggs’ without a hard outer shell, but do not select terms specific to this sense.  \n* Follow common usage, not strict biological terminology.  Certainly avoid technical terms such as _ovum_, and terms limited to specific types of biological egg, e.g. _frogspawn_.\n* Avoid terms limited to eggs seen as food.\n\n "
40,eye,1248,EYE,"The organ that is sensitive to light, which it converts to electrical signals passed to the brain, by which means animals and humans see.","##### Illustrative Context\n_She closed one **eye**._\n\n##### Target Sense\n* The basic term for the human eye.\n* Follow normal usage in the language, rather than technical anatomical definitions of what constitutes the ‘eye’.  \n* The lexeme selected must be able to refer to at least the part of the eye visible in the face, whether or not its usual reference can extend to the whole eyeball, the eyelids, tear duct, and so on.\n* Avoid terms specifically for the whole _eyeball_, or particular parts of the eye (e.g. _iris_).    \n* The generic term in most languages will also be applicable to the eyes of animals, but do not select a term that can be applied only to animals.  The lexeme selected must be the basic word for the human eye.\n* The default sense is the physical one, referring to the part of the body, not the functional sense of the organ for the sense of sight.\n* Avoid terms used primarily to refer not to the anatomical eye, but to figurative senses of vision, watching or attentiveness.\n* Give the singular form, avoiding special dual/plural formations (e.g. the lexeme to give for French is _oeil_, not _yeux_). \n* Neutral, default register:  avoid technical, medical terms, and slang or jocular terms."
41,fall,1280,FALL,To descend in free fall due to the effect of gravity.,"##### Illustrative Context\n_I **fell** from the tree yesterday and hurt my back._\n\n##### Target Sense\n* The most generic intransitive verb for falling from a height, through the air, to the ground.\n* In many languages this may be the same verb as used for just falling _over_ from standing, walking or running.  Avoid, however, any verb that is limited to these senses.  The verb selected must be applicable to falling from a height, as in the illustrative context.\n* In many languages the basic verb may be applicable to objects falling as well as to people (as in the illustrative context).  Avoid, however, verbs applicable only to objects falling.  The verb selected must be applicable to people falling.\n* Avoid terms with more specific senses of falling _off_ a surface, _tripping up_, _tipping over_, etc..\n* Avoid terms that include reference or implications of the cause of falling.\n"
42,far,1406,FAR,Having a large intervening distance with regard to something.,"##### Illustrative Context\n_You can’t walk there in one day; it’s too **far**._\n\n##### Target Sense\n* The most generic word, typically adverbial, indicating considerable distance from a point of reference.  The basic antonym of [near](../wiki/Meaning:-near) — see also the IE-CoR definition for that meaning.\n* Avoid adjectives, if different, e.g. _distant_, _remote_. (Some languages with large adjectival classes may derive words for ‘far’ from an adjective.)\n* Avoid dedicated adpositions.\n* Avoid compound expressions, e.g. _far away_, unless one such compound really has become the most basic term for ‘far’.\n\n\n\n"
45,fear,1419,FEAR (BE AFRAID),To be scared of; to have an uncontrollable emotion of anxiety about something that causes a scared reaction or frightening impression.,"##### Illustrative Context\n_While the dog was here, I **was scared**._\n\n**Note:** the English lexeme _fear_ as a verb is for most speakers now a somewhat limited, formal or old usage. (The noun _fear_ remains very common.)  On these grounds, following the IE-CoR policy on register, the lexeme selected in English is (the more default register) _be afraid_ or _be scared_, depending on variety.\n\n\n##### Target Sense\n* The target sense is intransitive, i.e. for _being afraid_, not being afraid _of something_. \n* The target sense is stative, i.e. the condition of _being afraid_, so avoid change-of-state terms that mean _get frightened_, where different.\n* Depending on the language, the default intransitive form may be either marked or unmarked vis à vis the transitive form;  please nonetheless provide the intransitive.\n* There is no requirement or expectation for a simplex verb form like _fear_.  On the contrary, do not supply one if the basic expression in your language uses some other construction.  E.g. in French, the basic term is not _craindre_ but _avoir peur_.  Indeed in this particular meaning there is a great deal of variation in the precise constructions used across different languages, for example:\n    - Latin (rather unusually) does have an unmarked intransitive _temere_.\n    - Greek and Old Irish use a middle voice.\n    - Slavic uses a reflexive verb.\n    - Many West European languages have moved to light verb constructions such as _have_ + noun, e.g. German _Angst haben_, or French _avoir peur_.\n    - English has _be_ + adjective _afraid_ or _scared_.\n    - Irish has _be_ with non-canonical subject marking + noun.\n\n\n\n\n\n"
46,feather,1201,FEATHER,"A branching, hair-like structure that grows on the skin of birds and protects them against coldness and water and allows their wings to create lift.","##### Illustrative Context\n_What bird does this **feather** come from?_\n\n##### Target Sense\n* The most generic term for a single feather of a bird.\n* Avoid collective terms, e.g. _plumage_.\n* Avoid terms limited to particular types of feather, e.g. _down_.\n* Avoid terms specific to particular uses of feathers, such as for decoration, cushioning, or as pens (e.g. _quill_).\n"
48,fight,1423,FIGHT,To be involved in a physical confrontation.,"##### Illustrative Context\n_The two men are **fighting** outside._\n\n##### Target Sense\n* The most generic intransitive verb for fighting in the literal sense of physical confrontation with blows.  \n* In many languages, the equivalent of English intransitive _fight_ may be a reciprocal/reflexive or middle, e.g. French _se battre_.\n* The generic term may also extend to fighting with weapons, and at a distance.  Avoid words limited to those specific senses, however.  The lexeme selected must be applicable also to physical fighting without weapons.  \n* Avoid terms for organised warfare, e.g. _battle_, where different.\n* Default register:  avoid elevated, literary terms (e.g. _combat_) and slang (e.g. _scrap_).\n* Avoid more terms specific to particular types of fighting, e.g. _wrestle_.\n* Avoid terms that are predominantly figurative, i.e. ‘fighting’ in the sense of merely competing or striving against others or for a goal, e.g. _struggle_."
49,nail,1896,FINGERNAIL OR TOENAIL,Hard keratin part growing at the end of a human's finger or toe.,"#### Illustrative Context\n_He had very long **nails** on his fingers._\n\n#### Target Sense\n* The nail as a part of the human body, at the end of a finger.  \n* Beware the polysemy of English _nail_:  not to be confused with a metal nail for hammering!\n* If your language has a generic term for the nails of both fingers and toes, that should be chosen, e.g. English _nail_.\n* If your language has no generic term, then select then the word for the nail of a finger, not a toe.\n* Enter only the root that refers to the _nail_ part — avoid entering an additional compounded element that literally means ‘finger’.  The correct entry in English is thus _nail_, not _fingernail_.\n* The term entered should normally be applicable to the nail of a single finger, and will thus normally be a singular form.  Avoid collectives, unless that is the default base form in your language, and additional morphology is required to specify a singulative.\n* Unlike some previous Swadesh-type lists, IE-CoR distinguishes the ‘nail’ of a human finger from the ‘[claw](https://iecor.clld.org/parameters/claw)’ of an animal;  each is a separate IE-CoR reference meaning.  In your language, the lexeme may be the same for both of these IE-CoR meanings (arguably a co-lexification).  This is not necessarily a problem, and you should certainly not specifically seek out two different terms to distinguish the two.  If both IE-CoR meanings ‘nail’ and ‘[claw](https://iecor.clld.org/parameters/claw)’ fall within the usage of a single basic lexeme in your language, it is fine to enter that same lexeme as the entry for both IE-CoR meanings, in line with the standard IE-CoR protocol to enter the single most general, basic and default  lexeme in your language that also naturally includes in its scope the IE-CoR target sense.  See also the entry on the IE-CoR meaning [claw](https://iecor.clld.org/parameters/claw).\n\n"
50,fire,221,FIRE,"The state of combustion in which inflammable material burns, producing heat, flames and often smoke.","##### Illustrative Context \n_He was cold, so he moved closer to the **fire**._\n\n##### Target Sense\n* Most generic, basic and default noun for _fire_, preferably applicable both to the concept of fire in general, and to a concrete instance of (a) fire.\n* In many languages this will be the same term as used in the traditional Classical concept of the four ‘elements’, i.e. _fire_ as opposed to _earth_, _air_ and _water_.\n* The lexeme selected should fit the target context (as in the illustrative context sentence) of a relatively small fire, controlled and intentionally set, for heating or cooking.\n* The lexeme selected should normally refer to fire visible in the form of flame(s), but avoid terms that have the narrower and more specific meaning of _flame_ rather than fire in general.\n* Avoid terms with specific narrower and limiting senses or usage of any kind, e.g..:\n    - Terms that are more limited to the abstract concept of _combustion_.  Indeed, avoid technical register terms such as English _combustion_.\n    - Terms specific to particular _types_ of fire, such as fire burning down a building,  e.g. French _incendie_ (rather than the correct generic word _feu_).\n    - Terms with specific senses of intense, uncontrolled, damaging and dangerous fire, e.g. _blaze_.\n    - Terms with a specific sense of a naturally occurring fire, e.g. _wildfire_, _bush fire_.\n    - Terms specific to _indoor_ fires, fireplaces or hearths, e.g. French _foyer_ (even if ultimately derived from the same root as correct _feu_).\n\n**Note:** the illustrative case of modern Romance languages derive their modern default _fire_ words not from the original Classical Latin _ignis_, but from the Latin word _focus_, which _originally_ meant only ‘fireplace’.  Regardless of that derivation and original sense, though, the cognates of _focus_ have in modern Romance languages long since broadened semantically to displace the _ignis_ root entirely, and take over its semantic slot as the basic _fire_ word here.  So the correct target lexemes for these languages in IE-CoR are indeed _feu_, _fuoco_, _fuego_, etc..\n\n\n\n\n"
51,fish,227,FISH,A cold-blooded vertebrate animal that lives in water that moves with the help of fins and breathes using gills (Pisces).,"##### Illustrative Context\n_I can see a **fish** swimming in the water._\n\n##### Target Sense\n* The most generic noun for a live fish.  \n* Avoid terms specific to caught, cooked or prepared fish, e.g. in Spanish the lexeme in the IE-CoR sense is _pez_, not _pescado_ (literally ‘fished’).  \n* Select the most generic term:  avoid terms specific to either fresh or saltwater fish, for example.\n* Follow common usage in the language, not strict biological classifications of what are or are not ‘fish’.  Avoid technical terms.\n\n"
52,five,493,FIVE,The natural number five (5).,"##### Illustrative Context\n_Four plus one is **five**._\n\n##### Target Sense\n* The default numeral five, as used when referring to inanimate objects. \n* Avoid the noun form for a group of five, e.g. _quintet_, or for a ‘number five’ (e.g. a bus).\n* Avoid any different terms used specifically when referring to humans or other animates. \n* Avoid terms specific to counting up or down, if different, e.g. in Irish, or in Russian where the lexeme for IE CoR [one](../wiki/Meaning:-one) is _odin_, not _raz_ (used when counting up).\n\n* In some languages, the same word root for the numeral five can take different grammatical forms.  \n    * In languages that have gender, give the common or masculine form.\n    * In languages that have a contrasting emphatic form, avoid this and give the non-emphatic form.\n\n* See also the target sense definitions for all five lowest numerals covered in IE-CoR:  [one](../wiki/Meaning:-one), [two](../wiki/Meaning:-two), [three](../wiki/Meaning:-three), [four](../wiki/Meaning:-four), [five](../wiki/Meaning:-five)."
55,flower,239,FLOWER,"The reproductive structure of angiosperm plants, consisting of stamens and carpels surrounded by petals and sepals all borne on the receptacle.","##### Illustrative Context\n_What type of **flower** is this?_\n\n##### Target Sense\n* The most generic noun for a flower, prototypically a small plant with a single stem and single flower head.\n* In many languages the same term may be applicable more widely also to each of the individual flower heads of a larger plant or indeed tree.  Avoid, however, terms specific to those referents, e.g. _bloom_, _blossom_.  The term selected must be able to refer to the prototypical case of a single stem and single flower head.\n* Avoid terms specific to prepared or cultivated flowers, or to wild flowers.  Only if a language distinguishes separate terms for wild vs. cultivated flowers, and does not have a common cover term applicable to both, then select the term for wild flower.\n* Avoid terms specific to particular uses of flowers, e.g. for decoration.\n* Avoid terms that are predominantly figurative, in senses such as beauty, freshness, prime or vigour, e.g. the ‘flower’ of youth. \n* Follow common usage in the language, not strict botanical definitions of ‘flower’.  Avoid technical, botanical terms.\n\n"
56,fly_V,1441,FLY (MOVE THROUGH AIR),"To move autonomously through the air, without any part of the object or object's enclosure touching anything attached to the ground.","##### Illustrative Context\n_Birds can **fly** but people can’t._\n\n##### Disambiguation\n* The **verb** _(to) fly_, not the noun for the insect (a) _fly_, which is the separate IE-CoR meaning [fly_N](../wiki/Meaning:-fly_N). \n\n##### Target Sense\n* The general, default verb for fly in the prototypical context of birds flying through the sky.\n* Avoid other roots used in more specific senses:  e.g. _fly off_, _fly away_, _soar_, _flit_. \n* Ignore figurative, non-literal senses of English _fly_, when used to mean just _go fast_, _flee_, and so on. \n* In some languages, e.g. in Slavic, motion verbs like _fly_ may reproduce the (part aspectual, part directional) opposition between two separate roots for _go_ vs. _walk_.  For _fly_ this can correspond to an opposition between:\n    - a neutral, iterable verb _fly_, e.g. _Where is that bird flying to?_\n    - a habitual verb _fly_ (often morphologically more marked), e.g. _Little chicks don’t yet know how to fly_.  \n* In such cases, if neither root is more basic or default than the other, then exceptionally, both may be entered as synonyms.  See also the definition for the IE-CoR meaning [go](../wiki/Meaning:-go).  \n\n"
57,fog,249,FOG,"Water droplets or, rarely, ice crystals suspended in the air in sufficient concentration to reduce visibility appreciably.","##### Illustrative Context\n_I couldn't see the village because of the **fog**._\n\n##### Target Sense\n* The most generic term for the equivalent of _cloud_, but at ground-level, and dense enough that it cannot be seen through.  Contrast with the meaning definition for the separate IE-CoR meaning [cloud](../wiki/Meaning:-cloud).  \n* If, like English, a language distinguishes denser _fog_ (that cannot be seen through at all) from thinner _mist_ (that does nonetheless allow even large but distant shapes to be made out), then select the term for denser _fog_.\n* Natural fog, not necessarily caused by pollution:  avoid words specific to that sense, e.g. _smog_. \n* In many languages, like English, the same generic term may be applicable both to fog on land and to ‘fog’ banks out at sea, or rolling onshore from the sea.  Do not, however, select a lexeme that uniquely or predominantly refers to sea fog.\n* In some languages there may not be a basic word specifically for (ground) fog, especially in regions where fog is very rare, or in mountainous regions where the distinction between _cloud_ and _fog_ can seem less rigid.  In such cases, provide the basic term that speakers would nonetheless use to describe fog if encountered elsewhere.  If such a description would be a compound or paraphrase, then select the lexeme within it bearing the most specific meaning closest to _fog_, e.g. the lexeme for _cloud_ in an expression such as _ground cloud_.  In this case, the term selected may be the same as for the separate IE-CoR meaning [cloud](../wiki/Meaning:-cloud)."
58,foot,1301,FOOT,The part of a human’s body below the ankle that is used in order to stand and walk.,"##### Illustrative Context\n_She has injured her **foot** so she can’t walk._\n\n##### Target Sense\n* The most generic noun for the foot as a part of the human body.  \n* In many languages the basic term may also be applicable to the feet of animals, which is not an issue provided that remains the basic term the target sense of the human foot.  Do not, however, enter any terms specific to animals, e.g. _hoof, paw_.\n* The target sense is the physical one of the human foot.  Avoid terms that are specifically or predominantly figurative, i.e. the foot as the ‘lowest part’, ‘base’ or ‘foundation’, e.g. at the ‘foot’ of a mountain or of a wall.  \n* Some languages may use the same basic lexeme not just for the foot but also applied to the lower leg or even the whole leg (e.g. Russian _нога_), and have no basic term specific to the foot.  This should be indicated in the notes field, but is not necessarily an issue.  So long as this undifferentiated lexeme is the most basic, default word used to refer to the foot, then that is the lexeme to select for this IE-CoR target sense, even if its reference may also extend ambiguously to part or all of the leg.  That is, do not provide a narrower term only because it is more specific to just the foot, if that term is less basic than the undifferentiated ‘foot/leg’ lexeme.  See also the target senses for the IE-CoR meanings [leg](../wiki/Meaning:-leg) and [hand](../wiki/Meaning:-hand).\n* Avoid terms specific to the (size or length of a) ‘foot’ as a unit of measurement. \n"
59,four,1500,FOUR,The natural number four (4).,"##### Illustrative Context\n_**Four** plus one is five._\n\n##### Target Sense\n* The default numeral four, as used when referring to inanimate objects. \n* Avoid the noun form for a group of four, e.g. _foursome_, _quartet_, or for a ‘number four’ (e.g. a bus).\n* Avoid any different terms used specifically when referring to humans or other animates. \n* Avoid terms specific to counting up or down, if different, e.g. in Irish, or in Russian where the lexeme for IE CoR [one](../wiki/Meaning:-one) is _odin_, not _raz_ (used when counting up).\n\n* In some languages, the same word root for the numeral four can take different grammatical forms.  \n    * In languages that have gender, give the common or masculine form.\n    * In languages that have a contrasting emphatic form, avoid this and give the non-emphatic form.\n\n* See also the target sense definitions for all five lowest numerals covered in IE-CoR:  [one](../wiki/Meaning:-one), [two](../wiki/Meaning:-two), [three](../wiki/Meaning:-three), [four](../wiki/Meaning:-four), [five](../wiki/Meaning:-five)."
60,freeze,1431,FREEZE,"To reach a chemically solid state, by the process of cooling.","##### Illustrative Context\n_When water **freezes**, it becomes ice._\n\n##### Target Sense\n* The basic term, normally an intransitive verb, for water turning to ice.\n* The same term is in many languages also applicable to objects containing water becoming frozen hard, but the basic term selected must also be applicable to water itself.\n* Avoid terms limited to figurative senses of ‘freezing’ as simply an equivalent for being or feeling particularly cold.\n\n "
61,fruit,1507,FRUIT,A botanical fruit that can be eaten raw used as food.,"##### Illustrative Context\n_He picked **fruit** from the trees._\n\n##### Target Sense\n* The most generic term for fruit that can be eaten as food, typically fruit of a tree. \n* The most basic term may be collective rather than singular (perhaps with additional morphology to mark a singulative form). Provide whichever is the base form in the language.  \n* The literal term for edible fruit.  Avoid terms specific to figurative or metaphorical senses, e.g. _the fruit(s) of one’s labour_. \n* Avoid terms specific to any particular sort of fruit, such as terms specialised for smaller fruit, e.g. _berry_.\n"
62,full,1429,FULL,Containing the most or maximum amount possible in the given available space.,"##### Illustrative Context\n_An empty pot is easier to carry than a **full** pot._\n\n##### Target Sense\n* The most generic adjective for containing the maximum amount of something in a given space.\n* Avoid terms with specific overt reference to maximum capacity, e.g. _full up_, _overflowing_.\n* Avoid derived, resultative terms meaning _filled_, unless such a derived form has replaced the original ‘full’ root to become the default term, without retaining a specific resultative sense.\n* Avoid terms specific to particular objects or liquids that a vessel is full of. \n"
63,give,1447,GIVE,To transfer the possession or holding (of an object) to another person.,"##### Illustrative Context\n_He **gave** her a knife._\n\n##### Target Sense\n* The most generic transitive verb for somebody giving an object to somebody else.\n* The lexeme must be applicable to the prototypical case of an object being passed directly from giver to recipient, and from hand to hand, rather than indirectly.  (Many languages may also use their default term in wider ranges of contexts.)\n* The target sense is simply the transfer of an object from one person to another, without any other, more specific senses or implications of any sort, such as the motivation, purpose, or moral judgement of that act of giving something.  Avoid, for example, terms specific to giving seen as a charitable act, e.g. _donate_.\n* Avoid terms with specific implications of (transfer of) ownership or (temporary) use.  I.e., avoid terms specific to whether the giving is either temporary (e.g. _lend_) or permanent, for the recipient to keep.\n* Avoid terms specific to gift-giving, where different.  So in German, for example, the generic lexeme is not _schenken_ but generic _geben_.\n* Avoid terms specific to particular types of thing given, e.g. money.\n* Avoid terms specific to the particular manner in which a thing is given, or the conditions under which it is given:  e.g. _hand over, _give up_, _pass (on)_."
64,good,1035,GOOD,Having desired or positive qualities.,"##### Illustrative Context\n_That isn’t a bad idea, it’s a **good** idea._\n\n##### Target Sense\n* The most generic, default, unmarked adjective for positive judgement, as an antonym of [bad](/wiki/Meaning:-bad).  \n* The target sense is a general judgement of positive, i.e. beneficial or appropriate in the current context.  \nBeware the wide polysemy of the English lexeme _good_.  \n* Avoid terms specific to the sense of _morally_ right or _pure_.  There is no necessary implication of this in the IE-CoR target sense of ‘good’.\n* Avoid terms specific to any other sub-senses or contexts, such as specific terms for good weather, good-tasting, good-looking, _beautiful_, _‘cool’_, etc.. \n* Avoid marked, intensifying words, such as _excellent_, _wonderful_, _great_.\n* Some languages may not have a straightforward candidate lexeme for this target sense.  In such cases, as well as the illustrative context given above, consider also which term for ‘good’ works well in a wider variety of usage contexts. "
65,grass,606,GRASS,"A very large and widespread family of Monocotyledoneae, with more than 10.000 species, most of which are herbaceous, but a few are woody.

The flowers are inconspicuous, with a much reduced perianth, and are wind-pollinated or cleistogamous.","#### Illustrative Context\n_There is **grass** growing beside the river._\n\n#### Target Sense\n* The most generic term for grass as a general type of plant.  \n* In many languages, this generic term will also be the term used to refer to grass in the more specific context of the primary food source for grazing animals (wild and/or domesticated) such as horses, cattle and sheep.  Do not, however, select a lexeme that is _specific_ to this sense of grass as animal food.  Avoid, therefore, terms restricted to this narrower sense, i.e. terms equivalent to English _fodder_, _pasture_ or indeed _grassland_, rather than just the basic word for the plant (type). \n \n\n"

Avoid, however, terms that are specific to any such senses and are not the basic colour term.\n* Avoid terms that are typically limited or specific to green as the colour of living plants _only_, e.g. English _verdant_.\n* Avoid terms that refer specifically to particular types of plant or vegetation, e.g. _greenery_, _grass_, _foliage_ (especially if nouns!). \n* Avoid intensifying terms that imply exuberance and vitality of vegetation or landscapes, e.g. _verdant_, French _verdoyant_.\n* Avoid all and any near-synonymous terms, but which refer to a narrower colour range than the basic colour term for ‘green’, or to sub-shades of it:  e.g. _sea-green_, _olive_, _lime_, etc..\n* See also the target sense definitions for other colour terms in IE-CoR: [red](../wiki/Meaning:-red), [yellow](../wiki/Meaning:-yellow), [black](../wiki/Meaning:-black) and [white](../wiki/Meaning:-white).\n"
68,hair,2648,HAIR (HEAD),The hair on the head of humans (rather than the hair in general or the hair on the body).,"#### Illustrative Context\n_She pulled his **hair**._ \n\n#### Target Sense\n* The most basic term for the (body of) hair on the top of a human’s head.\n* This most basic, default term is in many languages a singular ‘collective’ or mass noun, e.g. English _hair_;  but in many others it is a plural, e.g. French _(les) cheveux_ (i.e. formally equivalent to English plural _hairs_). This is not an issue:  simply select the basic term, whether formally singular or plural.  (Cognacy in IE-CoR is based on the root, irrespective of inflectional markings for grammatical number.) \n* Select the term for the ‘mass’ or ‘body’ of hair on the head, *not for a single hair* (if different).  \n* The term that a language uses for a single strand of hair is not relevant, because that is not the target sense.  Various patterns are found.  In languages that use a plural form, the corresponding singular often refers to a single hair:  e.g. French _(les) cheveux_ is formally simply a plural of _(le) cheveu_, meaning a single (strand of) hair.  In languages such as English that use a singular mass noun like _hair_, this can be formally identical to the term for a single _hair_ (differentiated only by quantifiers as in _a hair_ vs. _some hair_).  Other languages may also have specific singulative forms to refer to a single hair.  These patterns should not influence the identification of the term entered, however, simply because a single hair is not the target sense.  Again, just enter whichever form (singular or plural) is the basic one in your language to refer to the mass or body of hair on the head.\n* Avoid terms that refer specifically or predominantly to hair not on the (top of the) head but on other parts of the body:  e.g. French _poil_, terms for facial hair (_beard_/_moustache_/_stubble_), body hair, hairs or _fur_ of an animal, etc.. \n* Avoid terms for specific kinds or colours of hair:  e.g. Spanish _canas_ for grey hair(s); _curls_ or _locks_ of hair;  blonde hair;  long hair, frizzy hair, etc..\n* Avoid terms that refer more narrowly to the character or a styling of hair rather than just the basic 'body part':  e.g. French _chevelure_, _coiffure_;  _head of hair_, _hairstyle_;  unkempt or shaggy hair, or non-neutral terms that imply any qualitative or aesthetic judgement.\n* Avoid technical, medical terms, if different.\n\n\n"
69,hand,1277,HAND,That part of the fore limb below the forearm or wrist in primates (including humans).,"##### Illustrative Context\n_He burnt his **hand**._\n\n##### Target Sense\n* The most generic term for the hand as part of the human body. \n* Avoid narrower terms that specifically mean the hand as a _fist_, or as outstretched, or the _palm_ of the hand. \n* Some languages may apply the same basic lexeme not just to the hand but also to the forearm or even the whole arm, and have no basic term specific to only the _hand_ (i.e. up to the wrist joint only).  This broad range should be indicated in the notes field, but is not necessarily an issue.  So long as this undifferentiated lexeme is the most basic, default word used to refer to the hand, then that is the lexeme to select for this IE-CoR target sense, even if its reference may also extend ambiguously to part or all of the arm.  Do not provide a narrower term only because it is more specific to just the hand, if that term is less basic than the undifferentiated ‘hand/arm’ lexeme.  See also the target senses for the IE-CoR meanings [foot](../wiki/Meaning:-foot) and [leg](../wiki/Meaning:-leg).\n* Avoid terms specific to the (size of a) ‘hand’ as a unit of measurement. \n* The target sense is the physical body part;  avoid terms specifically or predominantly figurative, emotional or judgmental, i.e. terms for hand in the sense of authorship, agency or skill (‘by my hand’), aiding (a ‘helping’ hand), accompaniment or support (‘hand in hand’), etc.. \n* Avoid technical, medical terms, if different. "
71,head,1256,HEAD,"The part of the body of an animal or human which contains the brain, mouth and main sense organs.","#### Illustrative Context\n_He has lots of hair on his **head**._\n\n#### Target Sense\n* Most basic, generic, default-register term for the human head.  \n* Avoid narrower terms for just specific parts of the head, e.g. _crown (of the head)_, _nape_ etc..\n* Avoid terms that refer specifically to the brain or intelligence, i.e. _brain_, _mind_, etc..\n* Avoid terms that refer specifically to the metaphorical sense of ‘head’ as _top_, _chief_, _principal_, German _Haupt_, French _chef_, etc., even if cognate to the basic lexeme for the literal body part in other languages.\n* Avoid terms that refer specifically to only the bony _skull_, etc..\n* Avoid specifically medical terminology, e.g. _cranium_.\n* Avoid low register or jocular terms, e.g. _bonce_, _noggin_.\n\n"
72,hear,1408,HEAR,"To perceive sound with the ear, without necessarily paying attention to it.","##### Illustrative Context\n_I **heard** a noise last night._\n\n##### Target Sense\n* The most generic transitive verb for hear, in the literal, prototypical sense of perceiving with the ears, passively and without needing deliberate intention. \n* Avoid other verbs that add the narrower meaning of specifically active, intentional or purposeful hearing.  That is, the target sense is that of English _hear_, and explicitly **not** that of English _listen_.  Compare with the analogous contrasts under the separate IE-CoR meaning [see](../wiki/Meaning:-see), i.e. not purposeful _look (at)_ or _watch_.\n* As in the illustrative context, the lexeme entered must be applicable at least to hearing any general noise, although as a generic, default verb it will in most languages be applicable very widely, usually to anything that can be heard.\n* In many languages the literal _hear_ verb can naturally extend to mean more specifically that one has heard a fact reported, i.e. involving not just physical hearing of sound, but also a process of understanding speech, as in English _I’ve heard that you’re leaving tomorrow_.  This is not in itself an issue, but do not enter additional lexemes that necessarily entail this extension.  Enter only the most basic, default lexeme for the target literal sense of simply hearing a sound, i.e. what the ears do, not any thought process about what one may then be able to infer from that sound.  In particular, avoid terms that mean _understand_ (and would therefore not be normal in the illustrative context above) rather than just _hear_\n* Avoid any terms that are narrower in stressing the ability to hear sounds (and/or speech) that are decidedly quiet or barely audible, e.g. _make out_, _catch_.\n* Avoid any additional lexemes that are extensions to any other more specific senses (as present in the English lexeme _hear_, for example), such as _heed_, _obey_, _allow to speak_, _judge on_. \n* Avoid any additional lexemes that are more specific in predominantly referring to only certain types of sound, e.g. speech, music, etc.. \n* The target register is the default, neutral one of basic vocabulary.  Avoid lexemes limited to other registers, e.g. _discern_, French _capter_, etc..\n\n"
73,heart,1223,HEART,A muscular organ that pumps blood through the body.,"#### Illustrative Context\n_Your **heart** beats fast when you are in love._\n\n#### Target Sense\nMost generic term for the muscular organ of human beings that pumps blood around the body. Avoid specifically medical terminology, where different. Avoid metaphorical extensions, e.g. for life or courage. Heart exclusive of the general complex including liver, kidneys, etc.\n\n#### justification:"
74,heavy,1210,HEAVY,"Of a physical object, having great weight.","#### Illustrative Context\n_The rock was **heavy**._\n\n#### Target Sense\n* The most generic adjective expressing the considerable weight of a physical object.\n* The default opposite of 'light':  avoid intensive terms meaning _especially_ heavy.  \n* Use the basic term for the literal sense, referring to the weight of an object.  Avoid terms restricted to figurative senses, such as ‘difficult’, ‘serious’, ‘taxing’, ‘uncomfortable’.  \n* In some languages the adjectival form may be morphologically complex, often derived from a basic verbal root for weigh, be heavy’, e.g. Spanish _pesado_ and Italian _pesante_.  Provided that such a derivation has become the default adjectival form for 'heavy' in a given language, then that is the appropriate lexeme to select for that language.  Otherwise, avoid derivations such as English _weighty_, if not the default adjective.\n"
76,hit,1433,HIT,"To hit against with a sharp blow or to impel, usually with a hand or weapon or to be forcefully or suddenly contacting, e.g. a tree falling down and hitting the ground.","#### Illustrative Context\n_He **hit** the chair with the stick._\n\n#### Target Sense\n* Most generic and neutral transitive verb for a human agent hitting one object with another object.  \n\n* Beware the polysemy of English 'hit'.  The target sense is *not* that of success in hitting a target, i.e. the target sense is *not* the opposite of 'miss'.  So in German, for example, the form is 'schlagen' and not 'treffen'.\n\n* ""Most generic and neutral"" means that you should avoid close synonyms that are not neutral, and instead have more specific extra connotations, including any of the following:\n  - Avoid verbs that connote hitting with special force or resulting in breaking, e.g. 'whack', 'smash'.\n  - Avoid verbs with specific connotations of hitting for punishment, e.g. 'beat'.\n  - Avoid verbs specifically for repeated 'beating'; select a basic neutral verb that also works for a single hit.\n  - Avoid verbs specific to hitting directly with a particular part of the body, especially the fist, e.g. 'punch', 'thump'.\n  - Avoid verbs specific to hitting with given types of instrument:  e.g. 'club'.\n\nIn general this meaning is rather problematic, see:  https://github.com/lingdb/IELex2-CognaC/issues/19"
78,horn,1393,HORN (ANATOMY),A hard growth of keratin that protrudes from the top of the head of certain animals.,"##### Illustrative Context\n_Some animals have **horns**.  People do not._\n\n##### Target Sense\n* The most generic noun for a horn as a part of the body of various animals, specifically a growth from the top of the head.\n* The lexeme entered must be the default lexeme in the basic vocabulary that would be used in the prototypical case of a curly, pointed, keratin horn of an animal like a bull, goat or (horned) sheep. \n* Follow common usage and basic vocabulary.  Strict technical and biological classification criteria are not necessarily relevant — on this, see also the definitions for the separate IE-CoR meanings [wing](../wiki/Meaning:-wing), [snake](../wiki/Meaning:-snake) and [ant](../wiki/Meaning:-ant).  So although lexeme entered must be the basic lexeme in the prototypical case as defined above, the exact range of application of the basic lexeme does not necessarily matter.  Some languages, for example, extend the same basic term also to somewhat analogous bone structures such as _antlers_.  This is not in itself a concern, so long as this is also the default lexeme for the prototypical horn.  Do not, however, enter any additional lexeme that is specific to any such narrower use and not to true horns, e.g. English _antler_.\n* The lexeme selected must be able to refer to a single horn, or pair of horns, on a living animal.  Do not enter any additional lexeme used to refer exclusively or predominantly to a horn already removed from an animal’s head.  That is:\n    - Avoid any separate (non-count) lexemes for horn as a general material, e.g. to make objects from, such as combs. \n    - Avoid any lexemes specific to possible uses of horns, e.g. as a musical instrument (e.g. French _cor_ rather than target _corne_ Spanish _corno_ rather than target _cuerno_), drinking cup, etc.. \n* The target sense is the literal body part of an animal.  Do not enter any additional lexemes that predominantly refer to figurative and cultural senses, e.g. horns as symbolic of a cuckold, the devil, a dilemma, etc..\n\n\n"
80,hunt,1435,HUNT,To chase down prey and (usually) kill it.,"##### Illustrative Context\n_He is **hunting** animals in the forest._\n\n##### Target Sense\n* The most generic transitive verb for hunt, in the prototypical sense of a human tracking or chasing an animal, with the intention of catching (and usually killing) it, often to eat its meat.\n* The lexeme entered should be applicable to hunting in which the hunter must cover some ground, in order to find, track and catch (or shoot) the prey animal, usually one fairly large animal at a time.  It should be the generic term for this whole sequence of activities, but towards the single goal that defines ‘hunting’.  Do not select narrower lexemes for just one or other activity that constitutes just one stage of the overall ’hunt’ meaning.  That is, avoid lexemes for _track_, _catch_, _shoot_, etc..\n* The target sense is for hunting by people, although in many languages the preferred generic word may, as with English _hunt_, be applicable also to predator animals ‘hunting’ other animals.  This is not a concern, provided that the lexeme entered is nonetheless also the default word for humans hunting. Avoid any lexeme specific to hunting by predator animals, however.\n* The lexeme entered should be applicable to a prototypical hunted land animal such as a deer, although as a generic term it will typically extend more widely to hunting birds and large aquatic animals (e.g. seals), as with English _hunt_.  Some languages may extend the same root further still, to fish (whereas English typically distinguishes this with the verb _fish_), and to more indiscriminate catching of large numbers of animals like fish, rather than the prototypical sense of _hunting_ one larger animal at a time. Do not, however, enter any additional lexeme specific to fishing or to any other particular animal type as the quarry. \n* The target sense is the literal one as in the illustrative context, with an animal as the quarry hunted.  Do not enter additional lexemes that are figurative extensions of the English lexeme _hunt_, e.g, terms for ‘hunting’ success, a prize or a hidden object or person;  police ‘hunting’ criminals or escapees, etc..\n* The target sense is also the activity of hunting prototypically for sustenance, e.g. in the sense of ‘hunter-gatherers’.  Do not enter any additional lexemes specific to hunting seen instead as recreation (e.g. big game ‘hunting’).\n\n\n\n"
83,ice,617,ICE,The dense substance formed by the freezing of water to the solid state; it commonly occurs in the form of hexagonal crystals.,"#### Illustrative Context\n_**Ice** is frozen water._\n\n#### Target Sense\n* The most basic and generic noun for frozen (i.e. solid) water.  \n* This should be applicable to a tangible lump of ice or a layer on top of water.  In most languages, the default term will be the prototypical one applied to the frozen surface of a pond, for example. \n* Avoid more specific terms for ice in various particular forms and weather conditions:  i.e. do *not* enter terms specific to _hail_, _snow_, _frost_, _glacier_, _icicle_, and so on.  \n* Avoid terms specific to particular uses of ice, e.g. French _glaçon_ (_ice-cube_ or _block_) for cooling, _ice(-cream)_ for eating, etc..\n* Avoid figurative terms, for ice as symbolic of coldness, unfriendliness, white/blue colour, and so on."
86,kill,1417,KILL,To put to death; to end a life.,"##### Illustrative Context\n_They started fighting.  He **killed** him._\n\n##### Target Sense\n* Most generic and neutral transitive verb for killing in the literal sense of ending the life of a living being. \n* The lexeme selected must be applicable to killing humans (as in the illustrative context), but preferably not exclusively so.  In most languages (as in English) the most basic, default term is also applicable to killing animals or even also plants.  \n* Do not, however, select a term specific (or predominantly applied) to killing only humans, e.g. _murder_, unless the language has no basic ‘kill’ lexeme that is wider and more generic.  \n* Do not select a term specific (or predominantly applied) to killing only animals, e.g. _slaughter_, or plants.\n* Select the most neutral, basic term, i.e. avoid all terms that are narrower in that they bear additional and more specific meanings or overtones, including emotionally charged or judgmental ones, e.g.:\n    - Avoid intensive terms stressing the violence, brutality or number of people killed, e.g. _massacre_. \n    - Avoid euphemistic terms, e.g. _euthanise_. \n    - Avoid terms that are predominantly figurative, e.g. for ‘killing’ pain, a plan, hopes, etc..\n* Avoid terms that are specific to or predominantly used in a non-default register, e.g. literary _slay_, slang _do in_, or legal terms implying premeditation, intention or sentencing, e.g. _murder_, _execute_.\n* The basic term in a language may have originated in some such register, but since lost those connotations and become simply the normal default term for kill.  If so, then it is indeed now the lexeme in the IE-CoR target sense, and should be selected. \n* Avoid narrower terms specific to particular ways of killing, e.g. _slay_, _shoot (dead)_, German _erschießen_. \n* Avoid narrower terms that specifically denote or imply that the agent is non-animate, e.g. diseases ‘killing’ people. \n* Some languages use a causative construction of the type _make die_, and may thus share the same root as used in the separate IE-CoR meaning [die](../wiki/Meaning:-die).  This is not necessarily an issue, so long as this lexeme is the basic, most generic and neutral verb for kill in the language, and therefore should indeed be the entry for this meaning.  Certainly, do not provide an alternative lexeme simply out of a preference for a morphologically simplex stem, if that lexeme is less basic or generic than the causative construction.   \n* See also the target specification for the separate IE-CoR meaning [die](../wiki/Meaning:-die)."
87,knee,1371,KNEE,"In man, the joint in the middle part of the leg.","##### Illustrative Context\n_He put his hand on his **knee**._\n\n##### Target Sense\n* The most generic term for the knee as a part of the human body.\n* The term entered should be generic in referring to the articulation (as a whole) between the upper (thigh) and lower (shin/calf) parts of the leg, in the sense of the leg _bending at the knee_.  \n* Avoid narrower terms that refer to only more specific parts of the knee joint, e.g. English _kneecap_.\n* In most languages, and as in the illustrative context, the basic term for knee also has a prototypical application to the ‘front’ of the knee, upon which one might kneel, or rest one’s hand.  Do not enter terms such as the little-known English word _hough_, that refer instead to the ‘hollow’ _behind_ the knee. \n* In many languages the root used for this noun meaning also forms part of the corresponding verbal expression for _kneel_, as in English, in French _s’a**genou**iller_ or Spanish _ar**rodilla**rse_.  This is normal, but given that the target meaning here is the noun, provide only that form, not the verb form.\n* Give the form applicable to one knee, as in the illustrative context.  Usually this will of course be the singular form;  avoid any special dual/plural formations.  A dual/plural form should only be given if it is the basic, default form in a given language, which would require additional singulative morphology to refer to just one of the two knees.\n* Avoid technical, medical terms, where different.\n\n\n"
88,know,1410,KNOW (SOMETHING),To be sure about something or be acquainted with something.,"#### Illustrative Context\n_“They’re coming tomorrow.” — “Yes, I **know**.”_\n\n#### Target Sense\n* The most generic verb for knowing **a fact**, having information about something. \n* Beware of the polysemy/broad applicability of the English lexeme _know_ .\n    - Do not confuse with ‘knowing’ in the sense of being acquainted with _people_ (or places).  If your language uses a different lexeme for this sense, e.g. Italian _conoscere_, German _kennen_, then do **not** provide this lexeme, but only the lexeme for the IE-CoR target sense of knowing a _fact_.  So the correct entry for Italian is only _sapere_ (not _conoscere_), for German it is _wissen_ (not _kennen_), for French _savoir_ (not _connaître_), and so on.\n    - Do not confuse with ‘knowing’ in the sense of being able to, having learnt or ‘knowing’ _how to_ do something, often related to the ‘can’ verb (e.g. German _können_) in contexts such as _I know how to swim_, _I know (how to speak) German_.  So again, the correct entry in German is _wissen_, not _können_.\n* The lexeme selected should be applicable to knowing an individual fact, as in the illustrative context.  Do not enter other lexemes with the specific and more abstract meaning of just being generally wise, intelligent, ‘knowing many things’.\n* The default term should be neutral.  Do not enter terms with specific judgement values of wisdom, ‘(all)-knowingness’, holy or sacred knowledge, etc..  \n\n\n"
89,lake,624,LAKE,"An enclosed body of water, usually but not necessarily fresh water, from which the sea is excluded.","##### Illustrative Context\n_Her house is beside the **lake**._\n\n##### Target Sense\n* The most generic noun for a naturally occurring body of still (and normally, fresh) water in the landscape, of the prototypical intermediate scale of English _lake_, in contrast to both a (smaller) _pond_ and to a larger _sea_.  \n* As a guideline, the lexeme selected **must** be applicable to a prototypical lake large enough that swimming right across it would be an intimidating challenge to most people, but not so large that it is not possible to see across to the land at the other sides of the lake.  \n* In many languages the default term may also be applicable more widely, but avoid other terms _specific_ to larger bodies of water, especially if seen as unbounded (e.g. _sea_, _ocean_, French _mer_), or that specifically denote relatively small scale (e.g. _pond_, French _mare_). \n* Compare with the similar approach to considerations of size in the separate IE-CoR meanings [river](../wiki/Meaning:-river), [forest](../wiki/Meaning:-forest), [bird](../wiki/Meaning:-bird) and [leaf](../wiki/Meaning:-leaf).)"
90,laugh,1355,LAUGH,"To express pleasure, mirth or derision by peculiar movement of the muscles of the face, particularly of the mouth, causing a lighting up of the face and eyes, and usually accompanied by the emission of explosive or chuckling sounds from the chest and throat.","#### Illustrative Context\n_When I saw him, he was **laughing**._\n\n#### Target Sense\n* The most basic and generic intransitive verb for laughing.  \n* Avoid terms for merely _smiling_, _grinning_ or _smirking_, that do not involve audible laughter.\n* Provide the most generic, non-specific term, and avoid narrower terms in any sense.  \n    - Avoid terms stressing some specific form of laughter, e.g. particularly loud, surprised, prolonged, hysterical, etc..\n    - Avoid terms that are specifically intensifying, e.g. _roar (with laughter)_.\n    - Avoid terms specific to disrespectful, suppressed or quiet laughter, e.g. _giggle_, _snigger_.\n"
91,leaf,628,LEAF,"The main organ of photosynthesis and transpiration in higher plants, usually consisting of a flat green blade attached to the stem directly or by a stalk.","#### Illustrative Context\n_He picked a **leaf** from the tree._\n\n#### Target Sense\n* The lexeme selected for the meaning ‘leaf’ in IE-CoR must be applicable (as in the illustrative context) to the prototypical sense of a leaf of a tree-like plant, predominantly thin and flat in shape, and of a prototypical size of the order of the leaf of a beech tree or oak.  \n* The default lexeme will of course in most languages be a broad term also widely applicable to leaves of many different shapes and sizes, including those of plants smaller than trees, but within that variety the term selected must also cover this prototypical case.  (Compare with the similar approach to considerations of prototypical form and size in the separate IE-CoR meanings [bird](../wiki/Meaning:-bird), [lake](../wiki/Meaning:-lake) and [forest](../wiki/Meaning:-forest).)\n* The prototypical colour – at least in the growing season – is green (given that the leaf is usually the main organ of photosynthesis), although the prototypical sense of leaf also includes that it is potentially deciduous, and thus may well change in colour before falling.\n* Do **not** focus on strict biological definitions.  IE-CoR policy is to favour basic, default terms, rather than technical, scientific ones.  So although technically, in biological classification, ‘leaves’ may encompass very distinctive physical forms, including the _pine needles_ of conifers, what matters to IE-CoR is popular usage, and how a language segments the semantic space, which typically does not strictly follow scientific criteria.  In the case of ‘leaf’, most languages focus on shape and size.  Select the most basic, default term, without strict attention to technical biological characteristics such as photosynthesis or deciduousness.  (Compare with the similar considerations in the definition of the IE-CoR meaning [ant](../wiki/Meaning:-ant).)\n* If the most basic lexeme in your language is a collective, then this can be entered provided that it is significantly more basic and default than alternative lexemes that could denote a single leaf.  In particular, if the term for a single leaf is a singulative, formed by adding additional morphology to the same basic root that is by default a collective, then that basic collective term can be entered, along with a note mentioning the singulative form.  (Since the root remains the same, this does not affect cognacy at the level of the root, as followed in IE-CoR.)  \n* Avoid, however, terms specific to the sense of _foliage_ where the language also has a basic term that can be applied to a single leaf as in the illustrative context.  The term in German is therefore _Blatt_, not _Laub_ (irrespective of the fact that _Laub_ is cognate with English _leaf_)., and in French _feuille_ not _feuillage_.\n* The term selected should refer to the literal leaf of a tree.  In many languages the same basic term may have other figurative senses too, but avoid other lexemes specific to non-literal senses of a leaf, e.g. a _sheet_ or _page_ of paper.  \n\n"
92,left,244,LEFT,Something that is on the left side relative to another object.,"#### Illustrative Context\n_He is blind in his **left** eye._\n\n#### Target Sense\n* The opposite of [right](../wiki/Meaning:-right) — see also the target meaning definition for that IE-CoR reference meaning.\n* Enter the adjective form, rather than the adverb.\n* Avoid forms specifically for the left hand, or that include a lexeme for _hand_, i.e. unless the original _hand_ element has become so semantically bleached that it is now just part of the basic default word for left, and could be applied as such also in cases such as the illustrative context, referring to the left eye.\n\n"
93,leg,1297,LEG,The limb of an animal (including humans) that extends from the groin to the ankle.,"##### Illustrative Context\n_He fell and broke his **leg**._\n\n##### Target Sense\n* The most generic noun for the leg as a part of the human body.  \n* In many languages the same basic term is also applicable to the legs of animals, or even more widely in a figurative sense, e.g. _a table leg_.  Avoid terms specific to any such senses, however, and which are not the default word for the human leg.\n* Where a language uses the same basic lexeme for _foot_ as well as _leg_ (e.g. Russian _нога_), with no basic term specific to _leg_ in contrast with _foot_, then that lexeme may be selected here, as well as for the separate IE-CoR meaning [foot](../wiki/Meaning:-foot).  Indicate this in the notes field.    See also the target senses for the IE-CoR meanings [hand](../wiki/Meaning:-hand) and [arm](../wiki/Meaning:-arm)."
95,live,2309,LIVE,To be alive; to have a life.,"#### Illustrative Context\n_How many years can people **live** for?_\n\n#### Target Sense\n* The most basic and generic verb for the state of being alive.  \n* In most languages this term will be perceived as contrasting directly with the lexeme for the IE-CoR meaning [die](../wiki/Meaning:-die), in collocations such as English _live or die_. \n* Avoid terms specific to living _in_ a place, e.g. _reside_, _dwell_, rather than simply being alive.  So in German, the lexeme for this IE-CoR meaning is not _wohnen_ but _leben_. \n* Avoid terms denoting existence (including of objects) rather than life, e.g. _exist_.\n* Avoid terms that inherently bear more specific and additional senses beyond just being alive, including emotive or value judgement senses, e.g. ‘living’ well, happily or (‘living on’) in suffering.  \n* Avoid terms specific to starting or continuing to live, e.g. _be born_, _survive_, _live on_.\n\n\n"

Responsible for thousands of biochemical reactions.","##### Illustrative Context\n_When he died they found that his **liver** was very swollen._\n\n##### Target Sense\n* The basic term for the liver as a part of the human body.  \n* If your language uses a different lexeme for the _animal_ body part (and potentially also as a food), then do not enter this, enter only the basic term used to refer to the human liver.\n* The target sense is the literal one of the liver as a physical body part.  Avoid any other terms for liver that predominantly refer to figurative extensions, e.g. cultural perceptions of the liver as the source of various moods, emotions or characters:  bile, anger, wrath, courage (or cowardice), etc..\n\n"
97,long,1203,LONG,Having much distance from one terminating point on an object or an area to another terminating point.,"#### Illustrative Context\n_This is a **long** rope; that is a short rope._\n\n#### Target Sense\n* The lexeme selected should be the basic term that contrasts with 'short' in your language.  Indeed it should be the basic opposite to the term you enter for the IE-CoR comparison meaning [short](https://iecor.clld.org/parameters/short) -- see the precise definition for that comparison meaning, too.\n* The lexeme selected should be the most generic adjective for a relatively big distance between two points, prototypically the two ends of an object (on its longest dimension, usually perceived of horizontally rather than vertically).  \n* The target sense is **not** that of a long duration in time.  (That may also fall under the scope of the chosen lexeme, as it does in English, but do not choose a lexeme like 'lengthy' or 'prolonged' that refers most basically to time rather than size.) \n* The target sense is also **not** that of tall in stature.  I.e., do not give the opposite of ‘short’ in stature, but the opposite of ‘short’ in actual length.\n* Some languages may have different lexemes depending on the type or form of referent:  rope, clothing, hair, snake/worm, and so on.  In such cases, the prototypical referent to consider is a long and thin object like a piece of rope or string.

98,louse,1392,LOUSE,"A small wingless parasitic insect of the order Phthiraptera that lives on humans, other mammals and birds.","##### Illustrative Context\n_I picked a **louse** out of his hair._\n\n##### Target Sense\n* The most generic term for a louse as a parasitic insect, in the prototypical sense of one that lives in the hair on a human’s head.\n* The lexeme entered should be the default term to refer to a single full grown louse, as one could individually pick off the head, as in the illustrative context.  \n* The lexeme entered will thus normally be a count noun in the singular.  Only if the clear default term in a language is non-count, and referring to a single louse would require additional singulative morphology, should this non-count form be entered, as the most basic in that language.\n* Avoid narrower terms specific to particular types, forms or stages of the life cycle of lice, such as the eggs, e.g. English _nits_.  \n* The most basic, generic term in many languages (like English _louse_) may not distinguish head lice and body lice, and may be applicable to both.  This is not in itself a concern, provided that the lexeme entered is the default word for the target sense here, i.e. head lice.  Avoid any different, narrower terms specific to body lice and which are not the default word applied to head lice.  Indeed, also avoid narrower terms specific to head lice, where a more basic term exists that naturally covers both.\n* In some languages, as generally with English _louse_, the same generic term is also applicable to lice that live in the fur, hair or skin of animals.  Avoid terms specific to analogous species on animals, however, and which are not the default word for lice in the hair on a human’s head.\n* Follow common usage and basic vocabulary.  Strict technical and biological classification criteria are not necessarily relevant — on this, see also the definitions for the separate IE-CoR meanings [horn](../wiki/Meaning:-horn), [wing](../wiki/Meaning:-wing), [snake](../wiki/Meaning:-snake) and [ant](../wiki/Meaning:-ant).  \n* Target the default register lexeme.  Avoid technical and biological terms, colloquial terms, and so on.\n* The target sense is the literal one of the small insect.  Do not enter additional, different lexemes in any figurative extension of the English lexeme _louse_, in the sense of something else unpleasant or parasitic.\n"
99,man,1554,MAN,An adult human member of the sex that begets young by fertilizing ova.,"#### Illustrative Context\n_I saw a **man** and a woman._\n\n#### Target Sense\n* The most generic term for an adult human male.  \n* In most languages this will be the term that is directly paired with the term for the IE-CoR meaning [woman](../wiki/Meaning:-woman), in basic phrases such as _man or woman_, _man and woman_.\n* Avoid hypernym terms for people, of either sex, e.g. the German lexeme for this meaning is _Mann_, not _Mensch_ (‘person’).\n* The lexeme selected must be applicable to a particular adult human male, as in the illustrative context.  In some languages the same basic word can also be used to refer generically to the human species, humans as distinct from animals, as in the (now declining) usage of English _man_ without an article.  This is not an issue provided that the term is the basic lexeme to refer to an adult human male, but do not provide a lexeme specific to this generic ‘species’ sense.\n* Avoid terms that inherently carry more specific senses of any type.\n    - Avoid terms specific to the place of a man in a relationship, marriage or kinship.  In many languages, the most basic and generic term is _also_ used as a translation equivalent to English _husband_, e.g. German _Mann_.  This is not an issue; but do not enter terms specific to the sense of _husband_, e.g. French _mari_ or _époux_.\n    - Avoid specific terms for younger or older men.\n    - Avoid weighted terms that inherently carry honorific or judgmental value:  e.g. _gentleman_, French _monsieur_.\n    - Avoid terms that specifically highlight perceived masculinity or virility.\n    - Avoid terms that are used to focus more narrowly as explicitly _male_, rather than more equally both male and adult, e.g. the Spanish lexeme here is _hombre_, not _varón_.\n* The neutral-register term:  avoid literary or poetic words (particularly in the sense of _hero_), and slang or colloquial terms, e.g. _bloke_, _guy_, _chap_, _fellow_.\n* See also the IE-CoR meaning [woman](../wiki/Meaning:-woman)."
101,meat,634,MEAT,"The edible flesh of animals, especially that of mammals.","##### Illustrative Context\n_What animal does this **meat** come from?_\n\n##### Target Sense\n* The most generic term for meat as the edible flesh of animals, prototypically: the ‘red’ meat of mid-sized land-mammals such as sheep, already cut from the animal’s body.  \n* The lexeme selected must normally be applicable to the meat of mammals (except in languages from cultures and regions where the default meat and the most basic term applies to a different type of animal).\n* In many languages, as in English, the same basic lexeme will cover a wide range of contexts and types of ‘meat’.  Where a language has no broad cover term, but only distinct, mutually exclusive lexemes for different contexts/types, in the following or any other cases, then always fall back on the most generic lexeme that includes within its scope the prototypical case as defined above.\n    - If a language has only distinct, mutually exclusive lexemes for the _flesh_ of a living animal vs. the _meat_ of one already killed, then select the latter.\n    - If a language has only distinct, mutually exclusive lexemes for the meat still on the animal’s body vs. already cut off it (in preparation for cooking or storage), then select the latter.\n    - If a language has only distinct, mutually exclusive lexemes for raw meat not yet cooked vs. already cooked meat, then select the former.\n    - If a language has only distinct, mutually exclusive lexemes for meat of different forms or colours , e.g. for the ‘red meat’ of most large mammals vs. the ‘white’ meat of poultry, then select the term for the ‘red meat’ type.\n    - If a language has only distinct, mutually exclusive lexemes for the meats of mid-sized land animals, of birds, of fish or acquatic animals, and/or of insects, then select the term for the meat of mid-sized land animals.\n    - If a language has only distinct, mutually exclusive lexemes for the meats of reared domesticates vs. hunted wild animals (‘game’), then select the term for whichever is the more basic among speakers of the language:  typically this will be reared meat among farming communities, hunted meat among foragers.\n* The target meaning is the literal one of meat as the physical flesh of animals.  Do not select lexemes that refer to food more broadly (the oldest sense of the lexeme _meat_ in English, as still in _mincemeat_).  Also, do not select lexemes that refer predominantly to figurative extensions, e.g. ‘meat’ in the sense of _sustenance_ or the core (‘meat’) of an issue.\n\n"
102,moon,1313,MOON,A natural satellite of a planet.,"#### Illustrative Context\n_I saw the **moon** and the sun in the sky._\n\n#### Target Sense\n* The term selected should be the basic, default word for the (earth’s) moon.  \n* In most languages this will be the term that is directly paired with the term for the IE-CoR meaning [sun](../wiki/Meaning:-sun), in basic phrases such as _sun and moon_, as in the illustrative context.\n* In many languages the basic term may also be applied to the satellites of other planets, but do not select technical or astronomical cover-terms that do not by default, when not further qualified, refer specifically to the earth’s moon, e.g. _satellite_.  E.g. in Russian the target lexeme is Луна (luna), not спутник (sputnik).\n* Enter the literal term for the celestial body.  Avoid loaded terms that inherently carry more specific senses of any sort, e.g. personifications of the moon, the moon seen in religious or mystical senses, the moon as a source of light at night, etc..\n* Avoid narrower terms for specific stages or appearances of the moon, e.g. _crescent_, Russian месяц (mesyats), _full moon_, _blood moon_.\n* Some languages use the same basic word also in the time meaning _month_.  Avoid, however, terms that refer _primarily_ to the moon in the sense of the period of its orbit as the time-unit of a _month_, e.g. in Russian the target lexeme is Луна (luna), not месяц (mesyats). \n* See also the IE-CoR meaning [sun](../wiki/Meaning:-sun).\n"
104,mountain,639,MOUNTAIN,A feature of the earth's surface that rises high above the base and has generally steep slopes and a relatively small summit area.,"##### Illustrative Context\n_He started to climb the **mountain**._\n\n##### Target Sense\n* The most generic term for a prototypically high mountain, as distinct from a mere _hill_.  \n* As a generic term within the basic vocabulary, the lexeme selected will typically be applicable to mountains of a wide range of sizes and scales.  Nonetheless, its range of application must normally include reference to the highest mountains in the world.  \n* Certainly, avoid terms such as English _hill_ that denote specifically something _not_ as high as the prototypical _mountain_.  Similarly, the French term is not _colline_, but _montagne_;  in German not _Hügel_, but _Berg_.\n* If a language has no one generic term, but mutually exclusive lexemes for different heights/scales/sizes of ‘mountain’, then select whichever basic term is applicable to mountains of the greatest scale.\n* The lexeme selected should be applicable to a single, standalone high mountain, prototypically with steep slopes.  \n* Avoid terms for highland regions in general, or for chains of mountains or highland plateaux, e.g. Spanish _sierra_, _cordillera_.  The lexeme selected will therefore usually be a singular form, not a collective or mass noun for _highland(s)_.  \n* Must be a generic term:  avoid terms specific to particular types of mountain, e.g. _volcano_, _fell(s)_, Spanish _nevado_ (i.e. specifically a snowcapped mountain), etc..  \n* Avoid terms for smaller-scale parts of mountains, e.g. peak, crag.\n* Avoid lexemes that are only or predominantly figurative, to refer to large quantities of or ‘heaps’ of things.  \n"

Where a language distinguishes the inner and outer mouth the term for the outer mouth .\n\n##### Target Sense\n* The most basic, default term for the mouth as a part of the human body.\n* The target sense is the prototypical one of the mouth seen as a whole, for which most languages have a generic term that can apply not just to the oral cavity, but can also take in the tongue, teeth and the lips as parts of this overall sense of mouth.  \n* Avoid terms specific to just individual parts of the mouth (e.g. _lips_) or for shapes of mouth.  \n* Follow common usage and basic vocabulary.  Strict anatomical or medical definitions are not relevant.  Avoid any technical, medical terminology.  \n* The term entered must be the default term for the human mouth.  As the most basic term, it may also be extendable to the ‘mouth’ or even ‘snout’ of other animals;  but do not enter any other terms applied only or predominantly to animals.\n* The target sense is the literal one for the physical body part, not any functional senses of speech, taste, eating, breathing, smiling, etc..\n* Avoid lexemes that are predominantly used only for figurative extensions, e.g. for the ‘mouth’ of a river (e.g. French _embouchure_), or for the sense of taste, the power of speech, etc..\n* Enter only the default, neutral register term.  Most languages have additional slang or jocular words (e.g. English _gob_, French _geule_), often derived from terms for the mouths of animals:  do **not** enter any such terms.\n\n"
106,name,1405,NAME,"Any word or phrase which designates a particular person, place, class or thing.","#### Illustrative Context\n_What **name** have you chosen for your baby?_\n\n#### Target Sense\n* The most generic noun for the name of a person.  Prototypically this should be the basic term that would be used in the illustrative context, where it can be expected that the family name is already known, and is not the focus of the question.  \n* Avoid narrower terms specific to a particular type of name (or even title), e.g. _surname_, _forename_, _nickname_, _sobriquet_.   \n* If (and only if) your language has no generic, umbrella term that can be applied variously to a family name, an individual identifying name, or a combined full name, then select the term that would be most normal in the illustrative context,assuming that the family name is already known.\n* In some languages, the most generic base noun (when not further qualified) may be ambiguous between the generic sense targeted here and one particular sub-sense, e.g. _Name_ in German can also be taken as specifically referring to the family name in a context where it is in explicit contrast with _Vorname_.  Irrespective of any such potential ambiguities and disambiguation techniques where necessary, however, enter the generic base noun as would be used in contexts where further specification is not needed.  So in German, the default, generic lexeme, as in the illustrative context above, is simple _Name_, not narrower _Vorname_.\n* Many languages use the noun less than English uses its noun _name_, and translation equivalents will often use instead a verb that more literally means _call (oneself)_, e.g. German _heißen_, French _s’appeler_.  Nonetheless, such languages do also tend to have a noun for _name_, e.g. in official contexts where identity is to be established.  Enter the noun form for this IE-CoR meaning, not a verb.\n\n"
107,narrow,1267,NARROW,"(Of a path, cave etc.) having a small width.","##### Illustrative Context\n_The canyon is wide here, but further down it’s **narrow**._\n\n##### Target Sense\n* The basic antonym of [wide](../wiki/Meaning:-wide) (i.e. of gaps, spaces), **not** the opposite of _broad_ (i.e. of objects).  That is, the lexeme entered should be the normal adjective to refer to a small (horizontal) **gap** or **space** between two sides, rather than the small (horizontal) breadth of an object or person. \n* If your language has a cover term for both, then as a basic, general term that is indeed appropriate;  but if there are different terms, select the more default one for narrow gaps, not thin objects or people.  \n* The target lexeme in English is therefore _narrow_, not _thin_.  \n* [Avoid intensifying terms](../wiki/01--Policy-on-Selecting-Lexemes#unmarked--neither-intensive-nor-attenuating), or those that are not neutral but primarily entail a quality judgement as (excessively) _tight_, (too) close a fit, e.g. of clothing.\n"
108,near,1942,NEAR,Not far distant in time or space or degree or circumstances.,"##### Illustrative Context\n_You can walk there easily; it’s **near**._\n\n##### Target Sense\n* The most generic word, typically adverbial, indicating proximity to a point of reference.  The basic antonym of [far](https://iecor.clld.org/parameters/far) — see also the IE-CoR definition for that meaning.\n* Avoid adjectives, if different, e.g. _nearby_. (Some languages with large adjectival classes may derive words for ‘near’ from an adjective.)\n* Avoid dedicated adpositions, e.g. _near (to) the river_.\n* Avoid terms meaning specifically _beside_, _next to_, _adjacent_, etc..\n* Avoid compound expressions, e.g. _right by_, unless one such compound really has become the most basic term for ‘near’."

Avoid terms specific to other animals, however, and which are not the default word for the human neck.\n* If (but _only_ if) a language has no generic term, but only terms specific to either just the front or just the back of the neck, then select the latter. \n* Avoid narrower terms that refer to what are internal parts of the body that run through the neck.  That is, avoid terms for _throat_ and _spine_, for example.\n* The target sense is the literal, physical body part.  Avoid other lexemes that predominantly reflect extensions to other senses, particular that of a thin connecting part, e.g. a ‘neck’ of land, of a bottle (e.g. French _goulot_), the _collar_ of clothing, etc., or figurative senses such as the neck as a vulnerability.  The basic lexeme for this meaning in French, for example, is thus the body part term _cou_, not the more figurative _col_.\n* Avoid specifically medical terms, where different.\n* See also the definitions of the separate IE-CoR meanings [knee](../wiki/Meaning:-knee), [thigh](../wiki/Meaning:-thigh), [hand](../wiki/Meaning:-hand) and [mouth](../wiki/Meaning:-mouth).\n"

This extension is not necessarily an issue, provided that the cover term is the basic lexeme used for the narrower target here:  i.e. new as applied to an inanimate object.  Avoid, however, lexemes that uniquely or predominantly apply to people (or other animates), e.g. _young_.\n* The target sense is simply that of age.  Avoid terms that focus instead on state or condition, e.g. _fresh_ (of food).\n* Avoid intensifying terms that stress that something is especially recent, such as _brand new_, or terms that focus on contemporaneity, e.g. _current_.   Likewise, avoid attenuating terms for something still relatively new, e.g. _newish_.\n* Enter the most basic, neutral term.

As the most basic term, it may also be extendable to the ‘noses’ of other animals;  but do not enter any other terms applicable to animals.\n* Avoid terms that are predominantly figurative extensions to senses of smell, fine taste, flair, etc..\n* Provide only the default, neutral register term.

This extension to a wider range of application is not an issue, so long as the lexeme concerned is the basic term for the target here:  old as applied to an inanimate object.  Avoid, however, lexemes that uniquely or predominantly apply to people (or other animates), e.g. _elderly_.\n* Avoid intensifying terms that specifically stress great age, e.g. _ancient_ or French _vétuste_.  Likewise, avoid attenuating terms for only somewhat old.\n* Avoid aspectual derivations such as _age**d**_, _age**ing**_ or French _vieill**issant**_, unless the literal aspectual sense has been lost and this lexeme has become a language’s default basic adjective for old.\n* The target sense is simply that of age.

So likewise, the French term is not _ruisseau_, but _rivière_; in German not _Bach_, but _Fluss_.\n\n* As a guideline, the lexeme selected **must** be applicable to a prototypical river wide and deep enough that it cannot be trivially jumped over, but must be at least waded across, more usually swum across, or indeed may be so wide, deep or dangerous enough that swimming right across it would be an intimidating challenge to most people.  \n\n* In many languages the default term will be applicable across a wide range of scales and types of ‘river’ (according to local geographical conditions).  As noted, however, avoid any terms that specifically denote relatively small scale (e.g. _stream_).  \n\n* The basic _river_ term in most languages is applicable all the way up to the largest rivers in the world.  French, however, is relatively unusual in having a separate lexeme specific to rivers of especially large scale:  _fleuve_.  This is thus necessarily a narrower, less default term than _rivière_, which therefore remains the correct lexeme for IE-CoR ‘river’.  (_Fleuve_ is **not** to be selected for French.)\n\n* Avoid any terms that are narrower also in referring to any particular type of river in any other sense:  e.g. _torrent_, _tributary_, Spanish _arroyo_.\n\n* The default term should normally be applicable to an actual specific river, and should not be a more abstract or technical terms such as _watercourse_.\n\n* Avoid any narrower terms that focus on particular characteristics of a river, and/or figurative senses:  e.g. extensions to senses of flowing or time (_river of life_), swiftness, tears, etc..\n\n* (Compare with the similar approach to considerations of prototypical size in the separate IE-CoR meanings [lake](../wiki/Meaning:-lake), [forest](../wiki/Meaning:-forest), [bird](../wiki/Meaning:-bird) and [leaf](../wiki/Meaning:-leaf).)"
127,root,670,ROOT,The absorbing and anchoring organ of a vascular plant; it bears neither leaves nor flowers and is usually subterranean.,"##### Illustrative Context\n_You could see some of the **roots** of the tree above the ground._\n\n##### Target Sense\n* The most generic term for the root(s) of a plant, typically mostly underground in the soil, that both anchor and nourish the plant.\n* As a generic term, this will typically be applicable to many (almost all) types of plant, although — as in the illustrative context — it should minimally be applicable to trees (as defined in the separate IE-CoR meaning [tree](../wiki/Meaning:-tree).  Avoid terms specific to the roots of trees only, however, except if your language has no basic broader term that can apply to both trees and other plants.\n* Follow common usage and basic vocabulary.  Strict technical and biological classification criteria are not necessarily relevant — on this, see also the definitions for the separate IE-CoR meanings [tree](../wiki/Meaning:-tree), [snake](../wiki/Meaning:-snake), [wing](../wiki/Meaning:-wing) and [ant](../wiki/Meaning:-ant).  \n* Avoid narrower terms in any sense, e.g. terms specifically for root plants that are edible.\n* In languages in which the basic term is, as with English _root_ or French _racine_, a count noun that in the singular can refer to a single ‘branch’ of the root system as a whole, then enter that form.  If your language instead has as its default term a non-count or collective noun, and specifying a single root (branch) would require additional singulative morphology, then enter this more basic non-count form.\n* The target is a neutral register:  do not enter technical biological or agricultural terms such as _tuber_, _rhizome_.\n* The target sense is the literal one of the part of a plant.  Avoid narrower terms specific to figurative extensions of the English lexeme _root_, e.g. for the root of a tooth, problem, etc..\n"
129,rotten,1728,ROTTEN,"Having changed its colour, smell or composition (partially or completely), due to being attacked and decomposed by microorganisms (relating to organic matter).","##### Illustrative Context\n_That fruit is **rotten**._\n\n##### Target Sense\n* The most generic adjective for decomposing or decomposed solid but soft food, typically fruit.\n* The target sense is the physical decomposition of an item of food, in all dimensions.  Avoid terms for relatively superficial, external effects, e.g. _mouldy_.\n* As a generic term, the same lexeme is in many languages extended to apply to a range of organic tissues, including the ‘rotting’ of other parts of plants such as wood, and the flesh/meat of animals.  Do not, however, enter additional lexemes specific to any of these other senses.\n* Avoid any additional terms more specific to the decay or dissolution of harder matter such as teeth or bone, or erosion.\n* The target sense is just the decomposition of the physical structure of solid but soft food.  Avoid narrower terms specific to any _smell_ accompanying that decomposition, e.g. _musty_, _putrid_.\n* The default term entered should be neutral, and generic.  Avoid narrower terms, not least those that inherently bear a value judgement (typically negative in this meaning), including the specific sense of no longer good to eat:  e.g. _stale_, _off_, _putrid_.\n* The target sense is the literal one of decomposition.  Avoid additional lexemes that are extensions to negative senses such as _corrupt_, _unjust_, _evil_, _useless_, etc..\n* Enter the neutral register term from the basic vocabulary:  avoid technical, biological terms (e.g. _putrefied_) or slang.\n"
130,round,1395,ROUND,Circular or having a circular cross-section in at least one direction.,"##### Illustrative Context\n_That table is **round**._\n\n##### Target Sense\n* The most generic adjective for round, in the prototypical sense of the shape of an object as (roughly) circular, usually in the plane of its largest dimensions.  Considered effectively an antonym to other symmetrical object shapes, e.g. _square_ or indeed _oval_.\n* As a generic term, the same lexeme may extend to objects that are round not just in just two dimensions (e.g. coins, discs, or the table in the illustrative context) but in three, i.e. spherical objects such as balls.  Do not, however, enter distinct, additional lexemes specific to roundness in three dimensions, e.g. _spherical_.\n* The term for literally (if roughly) circular, in absolute terms.  Avoid relative or attenuating terms such as just _round**ed**_, i.e. not basically circular but just without sharp or discernible corners.  \n* Similarly, do not enter additional lexemes for _elliptical_ rather than truly _round_.  Only if the basic vocabulary of a language has just a single cover lexeme — as the default term for objects whether roughly round or actually clearly elliptical — would that be the target lexeme in that language (as its only default term that covers the target sense and illustrative context here, even if also applied more widely). \n* In particular, avoid lexemes that do not primarily mean circular in a literal and absolute sense, but are figurative extensions with looser and narrower senses, e.g. English _rotund_ for the shape of a person’s body, particularly their girth. \n* The target is the generic adjective, relatively non-specific as to the nature of the (round) object in question.  Avoid other adjectives applied more narrowly only or predominantly to one or more specific types of typically round object, e.g. wheels, rings, discs.\n* The default register term, in the basic vocabulary:  avoid (even just slightly) more technical or elevated terms, e.g. _circular_."
132,salt,1274,SALT,A condiment (NaCl - Sodium Chloride) used to add to or enhance the flavour of food (commonly with pepper).,"##### Illustrative Context\n_She puts too much salt in her **food**._\n\n##### Target Sense\n* The most generic noun for _salt_ in the prototypical sense of its visible white and solid form, used for adding to food (as in the illustrative context) and commonly ground into small grains or a powder.  \n* The target sense is the noun (normally a mass/non-count noun) for salt as a solid or powder.  Do not enter the adjective _salty/saline/salted_, nor related nouns for  salted (savoury) as a type of taste, salt water (e.g. _brine_), etc..  \n* Enter the most generic lexeme;  avoid narrower terms that refer to particular types of salt (e.g. _sea-salt_, _rock salt_), preparations of salt in any particular form (e.g. coarsely or finely ground powder), etc..\n* Follow popular usage and basic vocabulary:  technical definitions in chemistry are irrelevant.  Avoid terms equivalent to (English) _salt_ used as a chemical term to refer to other ionic compounds.  The target sense here is only common salt as (predominantly) sodium chloride, used with food.  Avoid technical terms (e.g. chemical or culinary).  \n\n"
133,sand,671,SAND,"A loose material consisting of small mineral particles, or rock and mineral particles, distinguishable by the naked eye; grains vary from almost spherical to angular, with a diameter range from 1/16 to 2 millimeters.","##### Illustrative Context\n_She let the **sand** fall through her hands._\n\n##### Target Sense\n* The most generic term for sand as a form of material — a mass of grains of rock, shell, mineral, etc. — so small and granular that individual grains are only just distinguishable to the naked eye, and as one would find prototypically in a desert or on a beach, most commonly yellowish in colour.  \n* In most languages this term will be a mass/non-count noun, and in order to refer to any one tiny grain of sand may require singulative morphology or a quantifier noun such as English _grain_ in _a grain of sand_.  \n* Avoid narrower terms (and count nouns) that refer specifically to particular conformations of sand, i.e. terms for a (sandy) _beach_,  _dune_, a place or surface covered with sand, e.g. French _arène_, etc..\n* What in English is a distinct lexeme _sand_ may in other languages co-lexify with other similar meanings.  Enter, however, only the single lexeme in your language that is the default term in the basic vocabulary for the target prototypical sense as defined above, and would be used in the illustrative context (irrespective of what other wider senses it may also extend to).  Do not enter any additional lexemes that more specifically correspond to different concepts (in English) such as _[dust](../wiki/Meaning:-dust)_, _powder_, _[ash](../wiki/Meaning:-ash)_, _soot_, _silt_, _soil_, _dirt_, _mud_, etc..  \n* So if your language does distinguish, for example, a separate lexeme for the sand-like material on a river-bed or river-banks, equivalent to English _silt_, then do not enter this as an additional lexeme;  enter only the basic _sand_ lexeme.  The target term in English is _sand_ alone, and none of the other English lexemes mentioned here.\n* In the target sense here, sand prototypically does not contain significant organic matter and is not good for growing most plants in.  Avoid terms more closely equivalent to _soil_, or that denote a soil type, even if with significant sand content, e.g. _loess_.\n* Enter the most basic, default lexeme and avoid terms that are narrower in any sense, e.g. lexemes to distinguish:  \n    - Particular degrees of coarseness/fineness of grain size, e.g. course _gravel_.\n    - Particular degrees of dryness/wetness of sand, e.g. _quicksand_.\n    - Specific colours of sand.  \n* The target sense is the literal one of sand as a naturally occurring material.  Avoid any additional lexemes that primarily represent extensions to figurative senses, e.g. sand as representing dryness, elusiveness, impermanence, an obstacle, the passage of time, etc.. \n* See also the definitions for the distinct IE-CoR meanings [dust](../wiki/Meaning:-dust) and [ash](../wiki/Meaning:-ash).\n"
134,say,1458,SAY,To utter specific words or notions.,"##### Illustrative Context\n_She **said** that she would be late._\n\n##### Target Sense\n* The most generic transitive verb for say, as prototypically used to refer to a specific mention of an instance of speech, direct and/or indirect, i.e.:\n    - With a citation of direct speech:  e.g. _“I’ll be late”, she **said**._\n    - With indirect speech, introduced by a conjunction or other equivalent to English _that_:  e.g. _She **said** that she would be late._\n* In many cases, the default verb will be transitive also in being able to take as its direct object a noun such as _words_, _prayers_, _something_, as in _she said something strange_, or expressions of ‘pseudo-direct’ speech such as _say hello_, _say your goodbyes_.  \n* Do **not confuse** with verbs for _speak_, which can typically take as direct object a noun like _language_ or the name of a language, unlike the objects of _saying_:  a specific, individual phrase or utterance, or object noun standing in for one.  \n* The target sense is thus explictly that of English _say_ not _speak_, of French _dire_ not _parler_, German _sagen_ not _sprechen_, and so on.  \n* Avoid terms that add a narrower, explicit meaning of imparting information, e.g. _tell_, _inform_ (where the person informed may be the object of the verb), rather than any form of utterance (including those not addressed to anyone).  Note, for example, that English allows _say hello_, but not _tell hello_.\n* The broader semantic field here is in many languages replete with dozens of lexemes.  As per strict IE-CoR policy, enter only the single lexeme of basic vocabulary, most neutral and default in register, that best matches the definition and illustrative context above.  Avoid any additional lexemes that are narrower in any other senses, among them: \n    - Lexemes that inherently refer to a particular manner of speaking, such as loud, quite, fast, slow, deliberate, off-hand, etc., e.g. _exclaim_, _declare_, mention_, _drawl_, etc.. \n    - Lexemes specific to acts of reading or performances of texts, stories, songs, etc., e.g. _recite_, _recount_. \n    - Lexemes that specify two-way communication, e.g. _discuss_, _chat_. \n    - Non-neutral lexemes that have additional emotional sense or an implicit value judgement, e.g. _blabber_, _lie_.\n    - Lexemes from non-default registers, e.g. elevated and literary _utter_, _pronounce_, _cry_, French _fit_ (for _dit_), antiquated English _quoth_, or slang (e.g. French _baraguiner_).\n\n"
136,sea,1474,SEA,A body of salt water that is smaller than an ocean and generally in proximity to a continent.,"##### Illustrative Context\n_Her house is beside the **sea**._\n\n##### Target Sense\n* The most generic noun for _the_ sea, as a general environment, in contrast to land.  \n* The target sense is therefore the one particularly inherent in English usage _the_ sea, not in the count noun sense of _a_ particular, named _sea_ seen as a geographical unit in contrast to other ‘seas’.\n* To identify the basic, most generic lexeme in your language, follow only popular usage in this non-count sense.  In particular, do not focus on technical definitions or criteria, e.g. of what is claimed to ‘count’ as a _sea_ as opposed to a _lake_ or _ocean_ in geographical or cartographical analyses.  Ignore these count noun senses anyway.  Do **not** make judgements on the basis of the names of particular water bodies that may or may not be named as _lake_, _sea_ or _ocean_ (inconsistently) from one particular language to the next (e.g. the Baltic and Caspian ‘Seas’, but ‘Lakes’ Superior, Victoria or Baikal).  This terminology is inconsistent, and not relevant to the IE-CoR target sense.\n* The lexeme selected **must** be applicable to the prototypical case of sea that is of salt water, not landlocked, and in scale is unbounded from the perspective of an observer anywhere on land, i.e. sea that stretches at least to the horizon and whose other shore is so distant that it cannot be seen from any point on land.  Necessarily, this is far greater than the prototypical scale of English _lake_ and the corresponding IE-CoR meaning [lake](../wiki/Meaning:-lake).  \n* On the other hand, avoid terms that bear the specific geographical, cartographical sense of _ocean_, i.e. the largest scale of one of the limited number of specific named oceans on Earth, accepted in geographical terminology.   The term _ocean_ in English, like its equivalents in many other languages, represents a hypernym beyond the IE-CoR target sense of _sea_.  Do not enter terms for (or equivalent to) _ocean_. \n* Compare with the approaches to considerations of size also in the separate IE-CoR meanings [river](../wiki/Meaning:-river), [mountain](../wiki/Meaning:-mountain) and [forest](../wiki/Meaning:-forest).)\n* Enter only the default, neutral-register term.  Avoid all other, marked registers, such as literary, poetic or antiquated terms like _main_, _(the) deep_, French _(le) large_.  \n* The target sense is literal, the sea as the natural environment.  Avoid terms specific to extensions and figurative senses of the sea as vastness, wilderness, menace, oblivion, ‘highway’, etc. (e.g. _a sea of troubles, tears_, etc.). \n"
137,see,1409,SEE,"To perceive [images] with the eye, without necessarily paying attention to them.","##### Illustrative Context\n_I **see** him every day on the road._\n\n##### Target Sense\n* The most generic transitive verb for see, in the literal, prototypical sense of perceiving with the eyes, passively and without needing deliberate intention. \n* Avoid other verbs that add the narrower meaning of specifically active, intentional or purposeful observing.  That is, the target sense is that of English _see_, and explicitly **not** that of English _look (at)_ or _watch_.  Compare with the analogous contrasts under the separate IE-CoR meaning [hear](../wiki/Meaning:-hear), i.e. not purposeful _listen_.\n* As in the illustrative context, the lexeme entered must be applicable at least to seeing a human, although as a generic, default verb it will in most languages be applicable very widely, usually to anything that can be seen.\n* In many languages the literal _see_ verb can naturally extend to mean also _understand_, _realise_, as in English _I don’t see why_ or _Ah, I see._  This is not in itself an issue, but do not enter additional lexemes that necessarily entail this extension.  Enter only the most basic, default lexeme for the target literal sense of simply observing, i.e. what the eyes do, not any thought process about what one may then be able to infer from that observation.  \n* Avoid any terms that are narrower in stressing the ability to see things that are decidedly small or hard to distinguish, e.g. _make out_, _discern_, _spot_, etc..\n* Avoid terms that are more specific in any other sense, too:  e.g. _witness_, _notice_, etc.. \n* The target register is the default, neutral one of basic vocabulary.  Avoid lexemes limited to other registers, e.g. formal _perceive_, _observe_, _note_, or any slang terms.\n"
138,seed,714,SEED,"A mature fertilized plant ovule, consisting of an embryo and its food store surrounded by a protective seed coat (testa).","##### Illustrative Context\n_I only had ten **seeds** to plant and the birds ate them all._\n\n##### Target Sense\n* The most basic, generic term for a seed in the prototypical sense defined as follows:  hard and dry, typically roundish, as would be pecked at by birds, and in size typically between that of a mustard seed to a sunflower seed. \n* Languages typically distinguish a range of different terms, varying by type of seed and plant.  For IE-CoR, however, enter the most generic term in the basic vocabulary that covers the prototypical sense and would be most natural in the illustrative context above.  \n* As a generic term, the lexeme entered should ideally be applicable to more than just cereals, i.e. also to many flowers and relatively small plants, irrespective of whether they are a food source for humans. \n* Follow common usage and basic vocabulary.  Strict technical and biological classification criteria are not necessarily relevant — on this, see also the definitions for the separate IE-CoR meanings [tree](../wiki/Meaning:-tree), [snake](../wiki/Meaning:-snake), [wing](../wiki/Meaning:-wing) and [ant](../wiki/Meaning:-ant).  \n* Avoid terms that focus on seeds viewed specifically as a food source, to be ground into flour or otherwise eaten.  \n* Avoid terms closer to English _nut_, relatively larger and viewed as a food source.\n* Avoid terms specific to the stony cores of fruit such as a peach or avocado.\n* The lexeme entered should be applicable to an individual seed, and thus will normally be a count noun in the singular form, e.g. French _graine_, not _semence_.  Only if the default noun in basic vocabulary is a non-count or collective noun, and specifying a single seed would require additional singulative morphology, should this non-count form be entered.\n* The target register is a neutral, default one:  avoid technical botanical or agricultural terms.\n\n"
139,sew,1457,SEW,"To pass thread repeatedly through fabric or a material, using a needle, in order to join two or more parts or to make a pattern or motif.","##### Illustrative Context\n_He **sewed** the two pieces of cloth together._\n\n##### Target Sense\n* The most generic verb for sew in the sense of using a needle to pass thread, repeatedly and alternatingly, through two or more pieces of cloth, in order to join them together, prototypically for clothing.  \n* The lexeme selected should be the default term that would be used, as in the illustrative context, for sewing articles of clothing, by hand with a needle, whether or not that term extends also to sewing by machine, and sewing other materials.\n* Avoid any additional, narrower terms specific to other contexts, including the medical procedure to close a wound with thread, i.e. English _stitch_.\n* The target sense is that of sewing to join existing pieces of cloth.  Avoid other terms with more specific and/or different senses of sewing to repair clothes (e.g. _darn_), to actually create new fabrics from ‘threads’ (e.g. _knit_, _weave_), or looser terms for the overall process of making clothes (e.g. _tailor_).\n* The target sense is the literal one that involves using a needle, thread and cloth.  Avoid additional lexemes that are predominantly figurative extensions to senses of bringing together, alternating movement, etc..\n\n"
140,sharp,1396,SHARP,Having the ability to cut easily.,"##### Illustrative Context\n_A **sharp** knife cuts better than a blunt one._\n\n##### Target Sense\n* The default term, typically adjectival, for the good cutting ability of a knife or other cutting blade.  The basic antonym of blunt (used of blades predominantly in UK English) or dull (in US English).  \n* The target sense is that of **cutting ability of a blade, not the piercing ability of a point**.  Some languages use the same basic lexeme as a cover term for both of these senses, e.g. English _sharp_ itself.  In other languages that have no single basic cover term, however, enter only the basic term for cutting ability.  The target term in French, for example, is thus _coupant_, not _pointu_.  \n* The target sense is the literal one, as applied to the blade of a knife when cutting physical objects.  In many languages, the same basic lexeme extends to other figurative senses, particularly to intensity of taste or pain, acuity of vision or intelligence, or precision.  Do not, however, enter additional lexemes that are specific to such senses, e.g. English _keen_, which is now generally outdated in the literal sense of _sharp_.\n* The term should be one from basic vocabulary, in a default, neutral register.  Avoid technical terms.\n\n\n"
141,short,1645,SHORT,Small in length by comparison.,"#### Illustrative Context\n_This is a **short rope**; that is a long rope._\n\n#### Target Sense\n* The basic opposite term to the one entered for IE-CoR [long](https://iecor.clld.org/parameters/long) — see the precise definition for that meaning too.\n* The lexeme selected should be the most generic adjective for a relatively small distance between two points, prototypically the two ends of an object (on its longest dimension, usually perceived of horizontally rather than vertically).  \n* The target sense is **not** that of a short duration in time.  (That may also fall under the scope of the chosen lexeme, as it does in English, but do not choose a term like _brief_ that refers most basically to time rather than size.) \n* The target sense is also **not** that of short in stature.  I.e., do not give the opposite of ‘tall’, but the opposite of ‘long’.\n* Some languages may have different lexemes for ‘long’ depending on the type or form of referent:  rope, clothing, hair, snake/worm, and so on.  In such cases, the prototypical referent to consider is a long and thin object like a piece of rope or string.  As per the standard lexeme determination protocol, however, the lexeme selected should not be exclusive to that sense, but be the lexeme with most basic, broadest range that also includes that prototypical context.\n\n"
142,sing,1261,SING,To produce harmonious sounds with one's voice.,"##### Illustrative Context\n_I heard him yesterday. He was **singing**._\n\n##### Target Sense\n* The most generic verb for sing, in the prototypical sense and context of singing by a (single) person, with the voice, particularly by varying pitch, perceived as musical (and indeed often accompanied by music), and including actual words of speech.\n* As a generic term in the basic vocabulary, the same lexeme is in many languages extended also to birds and some animals (e.g. whales).  Avoid, however, additional lexemes that are specific to such contexts or senses.\n* Enter only the basic generic verb, neutral and of the default register, and avoid additional lexemes of any nature.\n    - Avoid terms specific to uses of the voice that are not strictly _singing_ in any of the respects in the prototypical definition above:  e.g. where the pitch variation is not primarily melodious and musical but either rhetorical or linguistic (e.g. _recite_, _intone_);  where the sound produced is seen only as a sound, and does not include actual words of language (e.g. _hum_);  and so on. \n    - Avoid terms specific to singing of a group of people such as a choir, and that would not be the default term for a single person singing.\n    - Avoid terms specific to a particular form, style and/or purpose of singing (e.g. ritual, religious or magical), such as _chant_.\n    - Avoid terms that include value judgements, e.g. as to how talented, pleasurable, musical the singing may be.\n    - Avoid lexemes specific to figurative extensions to noises produced not by people but by machines or even objects, such as crystal."
143,sit,1416,SIT,To be in a position with the upper body upright and the legs resting.,"##### Illustrative Context\n_He is **sitting** over there._\n\n##### Target Sense\n* The most generic verb for sit, in contrast to both [stand](../wiki/Meaning:-stand) and lie, i.e. with the legs resting but the upper body upright.\n* The **stative** meaning, i.e. ‘(be) sit(ting)’, rather than change of state ‘sit _down_’, ‘take a seat’.  So the target term in Spanish, for example, is _estar sentado_, not _sentarse_;  in French _être assis_, not _s’asseoir_.\n* As the most generic term, the same basic lexeme will in many languages (as with English _sit_), be applicable to ‘sitting’ either on a raised object (chair, wall, rock, etc.) or directly on the ground.  If your language has no default cover term for both senses, but different basic vocabulary terms for each, then enter only the one for sitting on a raised object. \n* The target sense is the neutral, literal one of body posture, applying to people sitting, as opposed to standing or lying.  In many languages the most generic term may extend to (or etymologically have originated in) one or more other senses, but beyond the basic term do not enter any additional lexemes that add narrower, more specific senses of any kind, e.g.:\n    - Lexemes for being ‘in session’ or ‘held in’ a particular place, e.g. French _siéger_ (of a court, parliament, etc.).\n    - Lexemes that carry vaguer locative and/or figurative senses of _be in_ a place where one often sits, e.g. an office.\n    - Lexemes for specific, narrower extensions of _sit_, e.g. as being immobile, vulnerable, etc..\n* See also the definition of the contrasting IE-CoR meaning [stand](../wiki/Meaning:-stand).\n\n"

This is not in itself a concern, provided that the lexeme entered is the default word for the target sense here, i.e. human skin.  Avoid terms specific to other animals, however, which are not the default word for human skin, and which may even refer to particular uses of animal skins:  e.g. _hide_, _leather_. \n* Avoid narrower terms specific to the skin of a particular part of the body (e.g. the _scalp_ of the head), or of any particular colour or condition, e.g. tanned skin, burnt skin.\n* Avoid narrower terms specific to other parts of the outside of the body, even if perceived to be associated with the skin, e.g. _(finger)nails_, _lips_, body hair or animal _fur_, etc.. \n* Follow common usage and basic vocabulary.  Strict technical and biological classification criteria are not necessarily relevant — on this, see also the definitions for the separate IE-CoR meanings [horn](../wiki/Meaning:-horn), [wing](../wiki/Meaning:-wing), [snake](../wiki/Meaning:-snake) and [ant](../wiki/Meaning:-ant).  Indeed, avoid specifically medical terminology, if different, e.g. _cutis_.  \n* The target sense is the literal body part.  Do not enter additional different lexemes specific to any figurative extensions of the English lexeme _skin_, e.g. as figurative for one’s _life_ or _luck_, or for any exterior, containing, surrounding or superficial layer, e.g. as formed on a liquid such as milk, soup, etc.. \n\n"

During the day it is perceived as blue, and at night as black.","#### Illustrative Context\n_There were white clouds in the blue **sky**._\n\n#### Target Sense\n* The most generic noun for the sky, as seen looking upwards overhead, in the sense of effectively a ‘place’, space or region of the environment where (or ‘under which’) humans live.\n* The target sense includes particularly a vertical dimension to this space, often seen as where clouds circulate, or that mountains rise towards.\n* The target sense is often also seen as the space where birds fly (up to) -- but avoid terms specific to the sense of ‘air’ as a form of very dispersed matter (rather than a space) that can be breathed in and perceived as wind, dampness, etc..\n* Similarly, the sky is often also perceived of as where stars can be seen, but avoid terms specific to the different sense of (outer) space. \n* Select the most generic term for the sky as a ‘place’, preferably a term that can be applied irrespective of time, light and weather:  i.e. the sky as the place perceived both as blue (or grey with clouds!) during the day, and as black at night.  \n* Avoid narrower terms with the inherent additional sense of day or daylight, or specific to just the night sky – unless a language has no common single term applicable to sky both during the day and at night.  In that case, select the most basic lexeme applied to the sky during the day.\n* Select the default, neutral term, avoiding lexemes specific to given registers, e.g. literary _firmament_.\n* Avoid technical and scientific terms , e.g. _atmosphere_, _ether_.\n* Avoid terms with specific overtones of weather, e.g. thundery sky, heavy sky. \n* Avoid terms with narrower additional connotations of a perceived specific shape of the ‘arc’ or ‘vault’ of the sky. \n* Avoid religious terms, e.g. _heaven(s)_, where different.\n"
146,sleep,1585,SLEEP,To rest in a state of decreased consciousness and reduced metabolism.,"##### Illustrative Context\n_He is **sleeping** in the house._\n\n##### Disambiguation\nThe intransitive **verb* _(to) sleep_, not the noun _sleep_.\n\n##### Target Sense\n* The most generic verb for sleep, as the basic antonym of ‘being awake’, and which must be applicable to a prototypical sense defined as follows:  the habitual sleeping by humans, during the night, for several hours as the main rest period during the daily cycle, in a natural (not induced) state of not being conscious, and lying down (typically in some form of bed). \n* The target sense is the stative one, for the state of being asleep, not other senses such as a change of state or inchoative _fall asleep_.\n* Avoid narrower lexemes that specifically intensify or qualify particular forms or duration of sleep, e.g. _snooze_, _doze_, _nod off_, etc..  \n* The target register is the most neutral one:  avoid terms that are literary, poetic (e.g. _slumber_), slang (e.g. French _roupiller_), or technical, medical terms.\n* Avoid terms specific to unconsciousness not through natural sleep in the daily cycle, but induced medically or because of injury or illness (anaesthesia, coma, etc.).\n* The target sense is the literal one, as in the prototypical context as defined above.  Avoid other, additional lexemes that have predominantly figurative senses, e.g. sleep as imagery for dreaming, rest, being unconscious, unresponsive or inattentive, as a euphemism for _being dead_, etc.. \n* The target sense is for sleeping by people, although in many languages the preferred generic word may, as with English _sleep_, be applicable to animals too. This is not a concern, provided that the lexeme entered is the default word for humans sleeping. Avoid any lexeme specific to the sleeping of animals, however.\n\n"
147,small,1246,SMALL,Not large or big; small in size.,"#### Illustrative Context\n_This is a **small** stone. That is a big stone._\n\n##### Target Sense\n* The most generic term, typically adjectival, for small size in an unspecified dimension.  The basic, default antonym of [big](../wiki/Meaning:-big). \n* The basic term will generally be applicable very widely, but must be applicable at least to inanimate objects, as in the illustrative context.  \n* Avoid terms that only or predominantly refer to the size of people.\n* Avoid terms specific to a particular dimension like height, width or girth:  i.e. avoid terms such as _short_, _narrow_ or _thin_.  \n* Avoid intensifying terms stressing particular smallness, e.g. _tiny_, _minute_. \n* Many languages have a range of terms in this general semantic field, e.g. English _small_ (the target) but also _little_.  Select only the default, most neutral term.  To help identify this, use the standard tests in the general IE-CoR guidelines, such as:\n    - Which lexeme is most used in wh- questions:  e.g. English _How **small** is it?_, more neutral and normal than _How **little** is it?_\n    - Which lexeme has the fullest and most normal paradigm:  e.g. English _small**er**_, _small**est**_ are normal, whereas _little**r**_, _little**st**_ are considerably more marked.\n* In particular, enter the most neutral term, free from value judgements.  In particular, the target lexeme should not inherently bear affective and diminutive senses of endearing, as present in most uses of English _little_ rather than the more neutral default lexeme _small_.  \n* Enter a full (adjective) word form, not an affix.  Many languages use diminutive affixes just as widely, if not more so, than an adjectival root for _small_.  Nonetheless, these affixes also typically have additional affective senses, so are often not as widely used in the neutral, value-free target sense for IE-CoR.  Enter instead the full word form that is most neutral in this sense, as would be used in the illustrative sentence.  \n* See also the definition for the IE-CoR meaning [big](../wiki/Meaning:-big).  "
148,smell,1586,SMELL (PERCEIVE),To perceive the presence of molecules in the air by inhaling them through the nose.,"#### Illustrative Context\n_I (can) **smell** smoke._\n\n#### Target Sense\n* **Perceiving** an odour, by a human, through the nose.  \n* **Not** emitting an odour, smelling _of_ something, e.g. a flower.  So not as in _the food smells good_.  \n* The **transitive** verb (form) used where the subject of the verb is the person who perceives the odour, while that odour, or the substance or thing emitting it, is the object.\n* Some languages (e.g. Slavic) have different verbs depending on whether the human subject is taken as either the experiencer or the agent (the same contrast that English itself has for other perception meanings such as _see_ vs. _look_ or _hear_ vs. _listen_).  In such languages, select the verb form where the human subject is **experiencer, not agent**, who perceives the odour passively, not actively and intentionally 'sniffing' for it.  So not as in _she knelt down and smelt the flowers_.   \n* Some languages do not have a specific verb uniquely for perceiving odours through the nose, as distinct to perceiving by other senses such as taste or touch, and so on, and use a more general ‘sense’ verb instead, e.g. French _sentir_ (for English _smell_ and _feel_).  In such languages, just select that more generic lexeme if it also covers the target sense here, as per the [general IE-CoR policy](https://github.com/lingdb/CoBL-public/wiki/01--Policy-on-Selecting-Lexemes#the-most-general-lexeme-in-our-target-sense).\n"
149,smoke,778,SMOKE (EXHAUST),"An aerosol, consisting of visible particles and gases, produced by the incomplete burning of carbon-based materials, such as wood and fossil fuels.","##### Illustrative Context\n_I could see the **smoke** from the fire._\n\n##### Disambiguation\n* The **noun** _smoke_, not the verb _to smoke_.\n\n##### Target Sense\n* The most generic term for smoke in the prototypical sense of the grey smoke that rises from a fire of dry wood (as in the illustrative context).\n* The most basic, generic lexeme will typically be applicable much more widely, but do not select narrower lexemes _specific_ to different contexts, i.e. avoid terms such as _exhaust_, or for specific types of ‘smoke’, e.g. thick or acrid smoke from the burning of plastics, specifically tobacco smoke, etc..\n* Not to be confused with _steam_, i.e. the vapour of evaporating water — unless a language (unusually) has as its only most basic term a lexeme that covers _steam_ as well as _smoke_.\n* Not to be confused with the separate IE-CoR meaning [ash](../wiki/Meaning:-ash), nor with _soot_ (as a solid), _gas_, _cloud_, etc..\n* Select the basic term in the default register:  avoid any technical or scientific definitions or terms.\n* Select the term for the literal meaning of smoke rising from a fire.  Avoid terms specific to narrower or figurative extensions, e.g. terms that focus on smoke as an indication of danger, pollution, for cooking, or an opportunity to confuse, hide, escape, or signal messages.\n\n\n"
150,smooth,1234,SMOOTH,Not rough; having a surface texture that lacks friction.,"##### Illustrative Context\n_He picked a smooth stone from the **river**._\n\n##### Target Sense\n* The most generic adjective for smooth in the sense of the quality of a surface as particularly even, without even small protuberances, such that the hand can glide over it easily (often, even pleasantly).  The default antonym of rough, in the same context.\n* Many languages distinguish various basic lexemes depending on the nature of the surface in question.  In such cases, enter the lexeme that would be most normal in the prototypical case of a stone, as in the illustrative context.  Do not enter additional, narrower lexemes specific to other contexts, e.g. for a person’s skin.  \n* Do not confuse with the meaning ‘flat’ or ‘level’.  The target sense is not about a horizontal plane, indeed a smooth stone in a river, as in the illustrative context, is typically roundish in shape.  A stone certainly does not have to be flat in order to be smooth.\n* Do not confuse with the different meaning ‘soft’, i.e. not resistant to the touch, and which can be compressed.  The action to determine smoothness is that of moving the hand to run it over a surface, not poking or pressing to try to indent that surface.  The lexeme entered must be the basic term applied also to hard, firm surfaces such as a stone, as in the illustrative context. \n* Do not confuse with the different meaning ‘slippy’.  The target sense here for ‘smooth’ is just that of evenness and lack of obstacles, usually seen as a pleasant perception and a desirable quality.  The target is not the sense of (in)ability to keep a grip on a surface, i.e. _slippy_, often perceived as an unpleasant sensation or undesirable quality.  Note the distinction that a smooth stone is by no means necessarily slippy, and may become so only because of water or oil top of its surface, rather than the smoothness of that surface itself.   \n* In many languages ‘smooth’ is most often seen as something positive and pleasant, and the basic lexeme can have this sense in appropriate contexts (the majority).  Do not, however, enter additional lexemes that inherently and inescapably bear clear value judgements.  The term entered should be applicable also in contexts where smoothness is not actually desired, e.g. _it’s too smooth, we need something rougher_.\n* The target sense is the literal one, prototypically of a stone in the hand.  Many languages extend the same lexeme to figurative uses, but do not enter additional lexemes limited to figurative senses in movement, appearance, perceived sophistication, and so on:  e.g. _slick_, _shiny_, _glossy_, _sleek_, etc..

151,snake,730,SNAKE,"Any reptile of the suborder Serpentes, typically having a scaly cylindrical limbless body, fused eyelids, and a jaw modified for swallowing large prey.","##### Illustrative Context\n_He jumped when he saw the **snake**._\n\n##### Target Sense\n* The most generic term for a snake as a general body-form of animal, in popular perception seen prototypically as a scaly lizard, without legs, and which moves by a writhing movement.  \n* Follow common usage and basic vocabulary.  Strict technical and biological classification criteria are not necessarily relevant — see also the definition for the separate IE-CoR meaning [ant](../wiki/Meaning:-ant).\n* Enter the most neutral term for the type of animal, of this body form.  Avoid narrower lexemes that inherently bear particular connotations, even if common ones, such as danger, unpleasantness, or indeed religious interpretations.\n* Enter the generic term for the form of animal in general.  Do not enter narrower terms for a particular type or individual species of snake, even if this is the most common in a particular region or language.  \n* Some languages have two (or more) common lexemes that may distinguish different types of snake, e.g. venomous vs. non-venomous, constricting vs. venomous, or by size.  In such languages, enter the most basic lexeme, the one with the widest applicability, especially if it remains also the default, generic term for snakes when the type is unknown or not specified.  So in German the default term is _Schlange_, not _Natter_, and in French it is _serpent_, not (venomous) _vipere_ nor (non-venomous) _couleuvre_).\n* If a language has no generic cover term, but only multiple terms exclusive to different types or sizes of snake, then select the term considered most basic.  If that is not clear-cut, select the term most naturally applied to a prototypical case of a venomous snake of medium size, defined here as between 1 and 2 metres long, and between 2 and 5cm thick.\n* In some languages, a lexeme that was originally specific species word has since lost that specificity, and extended to become the default term for the form of animal in general.  In such cases, this semantic shift does qualify that lexeme as the IE-CoR target, e.g. some varieties of Spanish use _culebra_ as the default generic lexeme, replacing _serpiente_, which has become more narrowly elevated in register.  (Contrast this with the corresponding cognates in French, where _serpent_ remains the default generic lexeme, while _couleuvre_ still refers more specifically to a particular type of non-venomous snake.)\n* Enter the default register term.  Avoid terms that are literary, poetic or otherwise formal or slang.  The target lexeme in English is thus _snake_, not _serpent_.\n* The target term is the literal one for the type of animal.  Avoid terms that are predominantly figurative, e.g. imagery for unpleasant animals or indeed people, e.g. _viper_.\n* See also, and contrast with, the definition of the separate IE-CoR meaning [worm](../wiki/Meaning:-worm).\n"
152,snow,784,SNOW,"The most common form of frozen precipitation, usually flakes or starlike crystals, matted ice needles, or combinations, and often rime-coated.","##### Illustrative Context\n_There was **snow** on the ground._\n\n##### Disambiguation\n* The **noun** _snow_, not the verb _to snow_.\n\n##### Target Sense\n* The most generic noun for snow, in the prototypical sense of precipitation in frozen form, as snowflakes (not hail), directly visible and perceptible (not frost).  \n* This must be explicitly differentiated from the broad sense of _precipitation_ of any form, which is too general, and a hypernym to the narrower  target sense for IE-CoR.  That is:\n    - Do **not** enter a more abstract term for _precipitation_.  Only in the rare case of a language whose most basic lexeme does not distinguish between (frozen) snow and (liquid) rain, then this may be the target lexeme, since this makes it also the default term used for the target sense and illustrative context here.\n    - Avoid terms specific to liquid (or even just partly frozen) forms of precipitation:  _rain_, _sleet_.\n    - Avoid terms specific to hail, as precipitation in frozen form but in the form of compact and heavy ice-balls, in contrast to the target sense of snow as light ‘flakes’. \n    - Avoid terms specific to frost, i.e. frozen dew from condensation, in contrast to the target sense of perceptibly falling (flakes of) snow.  \n* The target sense here is of ‘rain’ as in turn a hypernym that covers a range of finer distinctions, for snow of different types, intensity or duration.  Avoid any such narrower terms, e.g. English _blizzard_, _snowstorm_, _sleet_.  \n* Enter the most generic term:  avoid terms specific to snow either while still falling, or while already on the ground.\n* The target sense is the literal one, for the weather phenomenon.  Avoid any lexemes that are predominantly extensions, e.g. to concepts of whiteness, purity, etc..\n* Avoid any technical, meteorological terms, including for different types of snow (e.g. for ski-ing, such as French _poudreuse_).    \n* See also, and contrast with, the definition of the separate IE-CoR meaning [rain](../wiki/Meaning:-rain)."
158,stand,1442,STAND,"To be upright in an erect position, supported by the feet.","##### Illustrative Context\n_He is **standing** over there._\n\n##### Target Sense\n* The most generic verb for stand in the basic sense of a person being upright on their feet, in contrast to both [sit](../wiki/Meaning:-sit) and lie.\n* The **stative** meaning, i.e. ‘(be) stand(ing)’, rather than change of state _stand up_, _get up_.  So the target term in Spanish, for example, is _estar parado_, not _pararse_, _levantarse_;  in French _être debout_, not _se lever_.\n* The target sense is the literal one applying to **people** standing, as opposed to sitting or lying.  Avoid additional lexemes that are figurative extensions or vaguer locative senses, e.g. of a building ‘standing’ or being in a place, of words being written in a book, etc..\n* The target sense is the neutral, literal one of body posture, on the feet.  In many languages the most generic term may extend to (or etymologically have originated in) one or more other senses, e.g. French _être debout_ can **also** have the narrower sense of being ‘up and about’, Spanish _estar parado_ of being stopped.  Beyond the basic term, however, do not enter any additional lexemes that necessarily add narrower, more specific senses of any kind:\n    - Avoid terms that specifically and exclusively mean being awake and ‘up and about’, on one’s feet, as opposed to still in bed/sleeping/resting.\n    - Avoid terms that specify being stopped (on one’s feet), in direct contrast to walking.\n    - Avoid intensifying terms that emphasise standing especially straight and upright, stiffly, or motionlessly.  The target lexeme in French is thus _être debout_, not _se tenir droit_.\n    - Avoid terms that stress ‘still’ standing, as representing resistance, ongoing validity, etc..  \n* Some languages, notably in the Romance family, have historically grammaticalised an original _stand_ verb, such that it is no longer the basic main content verb for standing on the feet.  In Italian, for example, the original lexeme _stare_ is now an auxiliary verb to mark progressive aspect (e.g. _stare facendo_ as _to be doing_ rather than just _do_), or simply ‘to be’ in the sense of health (_Come stai?_ as _How are you?_).  Spanish and Portuguese have seen similar developments, and the original stand lexeme is now an additional verb for ‘to be’, specifically ‘be in a place’, or ‘be in an only temporary state’.  These verbs alone (_stare/estar_) are therefore no longer the default content verbs in these languages for the IE-CoR meaning here, which instead needs a fuller expression to carry that specific meaning:  the target in Italian is _stare in piedi_, in Spanish _estar parado_.\n* See also the definition of the contrasting IE-CoR meaning [sit](../wiki/Meaning:-sit).\n\n\n\n"
159,star,1430,STAR,A luminous celestial body that is made from gases (particularly hydrogen and helium) and forms the shape of a sphere.,"##### Illustrative Context\n_There were many **stars** in the night sky._\n\n##### Target Sense\n* The most generic noun for the stars of the night sky.\n* Avoid more specific terms for particular types or colours of star:  e.g. especially bright stars, twinkling stars, etc..\n* Do not focus on technical, astronomical definitions, but simply follow popular usage.  Do not provide technical terms, and do not be concerned if popular usage of the basic ‘star’ word can also extend beyond the technically correct:  e.g. English _shooting star_, or_morning/evening star_ to refer to the planet Venus.\n* The lexeme selected should normally be applicable to a single, standalone visible star, and will therefore normally be a singular.  Nonetheless, if the more basic lexeme in your language is a collective or non-count noun for ‘the stars’ in general (perhaps with single stars referred to by a singulative form), then that basic collective term can be entered instead. \n* Do not provide the proper name of any individual star, e.g. the _Pole Star_, _Arcturus_.\n* Do not enter terms that mean specifically the _sun_ (i.e. the earth’s star), which is a separate IE-CoR meaning [sun](../wiki/Meaning:-sun).\n* Avoid any terms that are used predominantly or only in more specific or figurative senses of ‘star’, e.g. for navigation (_lodestar, guiding star_), brightness, fame, or the figurative ‘star-shape’ (four, five or six-pointed)."
160,stick,1295,STICK,"A long, thin piece of wood, mainly left in the shape in which it grew, that does not bend.","##### Illustrative Context\n_He carried a **stick** under his arm_.\n\n##### Disambiguation\nThe **noun** _stick_, as a long, thin piece of wood, not the verb _to stick_ (i.e. _adhere_).\n\n##### Target Sense\n* The most generic term for a stick in the prototypical sense of a relatively long piece of wood, essentially left in the shape in which it grew as a branch, and thin by comparison to its length, albeit thick and stiff enough that it does not easily bend.\n* As a generic term, the target lexeme should be applicable to sticks of a range of thicknesses and lengths, but prototypically should at least be applicable to cases ranging between the length of a stick that one might throw for a dog to fetch, up to the size of a stick that one might use as a walking aid.\n* Some languages may not have a generic term that closely matches the range of the English lexeme _stick_, but a range of terms specifying size, function, etc..  In this case, select the most non-specific, default term within the basic vocabulary, the most free of narrower and more specific connotations.  \n* Avoid lexemes that refer predominantly to any narrower and more specific type, size or use of a stick:  e.g. a _stave_ as a weapon to strike with or a tool to hit or beat with, a _staff_ or _rod_ as an emblem of power or authority, a walking stick, a stick used for planting, for digging, for starting a fire, and so on.\n* Avoid lexemes that specifically contrast with the basic _stick_ lexeme in that they serve to highlight relatively smaller size, e.g. _twig_, French _baguette_, _bâtonnet_.  \n* Avoid lexemes that do not inherently and specifically apply to sticks formed of solid wood from a branch of a tree:  e.g. _cane_, _pole_, _rod_.\n* Avoid vaguer lexemes that do not inherently refer to the form as long and thin, e.g. literally just _(piece of) wood_, French _(bout de) bois_, rather than target _bâton_.\n* Target the most neutral register:  avoid terms that are literary, out-dated or slang in the generic meaning as defined here, e.g. _stave_, _staff_.\n* Compare with the similar approach to considerations of size in the separate IE-CoR meanings [stone](../wiki/Meaning:-stone), [leaf](../wiki/Meaning:-leaf), [bird](../wiki/Meaning:-bird), [river](../wiki/Meaning:-river), [lake](../wiki/Meaning:-lake), and [forest](../wiki/Meaning:-forest).\n"
161,stone,857,STONE,"A general term for rock that is used in construction, either crushed for use as aggregate or cut into shaped blocks as dimension stone.","##### Illustrative Context\n_He held the **stone** in his hand._\n\n##### Target Sense\n* The most generic noun for a stone in the prototypical sense of the illustrative context above, of a size that can be held easily in the human hand, and that can be picked up and thrown without significant effort.\n* As a generic term, the target lexeme will likely be applicable to stones of a range of sizes and forms, but must at least be the default term in the prototypical sense above, and in the illustrative context.\n* In particular, avoid lexemes that stand in inherent contrast to the basic _stone_ lexeme in a language, and serve to imply particularly large size, e.g. English _rock_, French _rocher_.\n* Similarly, avoid lexemes that are hyponyms of the basic _stone_ lexeme, in that they inherently imply any other narrower sense of particular size, form, etc., e.g. _pebble_, _gemstone_.\n* The lexeme should be applicable to an individual stone, as in the illustrative context, and will therefore normally be a count noun, in the singular.  Avoid mass nouns for collections of (small) stones, as a material, e.g. _gravel_.\n* Many languages, like English, extend the same basic lexeme as the (non-count) term _stone_ as a general material, e.g. _made of stone_.  This is not necessarily a concern, but do not enter a term that is only or predominantly a non-count noun;  where a default count noun exists, enter that instead.  Only if the clear default term in a language is non-count, and referring to a single _stone_ would require additional singulative morphology, should this non-count form be entered, as the most basic in that language. \n* The target sense is the literal one of a physical stone as a naturally occurring, made of a rock-like substance, and that can be held in the hand.  Avoid other terms that are predominantly extensions to figurative senses, e.g. of stone as symbolic of strength, durability, immovability, lack of emotion or compassion, etc.. Likewise, avoid narrower lexemes specific to other, non-literal meanings or English _stone_, such as _kidney stone_, the hard kernel of a fruit such as a peach, stones as markers (e.g. _milestone_), etc..\n* Compare with the similar approach to considerations of size in the separate IE-CoR meanings [stick](../wiki/Meaning:-stick), [leaf](../wiki/Meaning:-leaf), [bird](../wiki/Meaning:-bird), [river](../wiki/Meaning:-river), [lake](../wiki/Meaning:-lake), and [forest](../wiki/Meaning:-forest).)"

Where a language has no such single cover term, however, but only distinct lexemes for these two senses, then enter the lexeme of basic vocabulary that would be applied to an actual object, as in the illustrative context, not a line or path.\n* The target sense is the physical form of an object.  Avoid terms that are instead specific to a directional sense of _straight ahead_, and presume motion to a goal, e.g. _direct_.\n* The target sense is the literal, neutral one of the form of an object.

166,swim,1439,SWIM,"To move through the water, without touching the bottom.","##### Illustrative Context\n_He is **swimming** in the lake._\n\n##### Target Sense\n* The most generic term for swim as an intransitive verb, in the prototypical context of a human swimming in the water of a lake or river.\n* Avoid other lexemes applicable to people in water but which do not meet the prototypical criteria for swimming, as relatively demanding of muscular effort, in order move through water.  That is, **avoid** terms with different meanings, such as:\n    - _bathe_ (or French _se baigner_) for generally just ‘being in water’\n    - _float_, i.e. without muscular effort\n    - _tread water_, i.e. with muscular effort, but without moving _through_ water  \n    - _wade_, i.e. advancing through water, but largely by walking through it, with one’s feet on the bottom.\n* Enter the default lexeme in the basic vocabulary, for the action in general.  Avoid narrower terms that focus on particular purposes in swimming, e.g. as a recreational or sporting activity (i.e. ‘going for a swim’), or to wash, or to avoid drowning.  \n* Although the target sense includes specifically moving through water, enter the most generic, basic lexeme, which should not be explicitly directional.  The default lexeme will therefore typically be a bare root without additional directional morphemes (e.g. equivalent to English _across_, _over_, _away_, _up_, etc.).  On this, see also the definitions for the separate IE-CoR definitions for other motion verbs such as [go](../wiki/Meaning:-go) and [fly](../wiki/Meaning:-fly_V).\n* Some languages do not have a dedicated simplex verb root equivalent to English _swim_.  In such cases, the basic lexeme to enter for this meaning is whatever periphrastic expression corresponds most closely, which may be a weak verb, adverbial phrase, etc., and may be literally equivalent to _go in water_.  See also the similar issue in the definition for the separate IE-CoR meaning [walk](../wiki/Meaning:-walk).\n* The basic target sense is for swimming by people, although in many languages the preferred generic word may, as with English _swim_, be applicable to animals too, including fish and other aquatic animals.  This is not in itself a concern, provided that the lexeme entered is the default word for the target sense here, i.e. as applied to humans swimming.  Avoid terms specific to swimming by animals, however, which are not the default word for humans. \n* Similarly, in some languages the same lexeme may even be applicable to boats, i.e. equivalent to the English verb _sail_, as in Russian _плавать (на лодке)_, _plavat’ na lodke_.  But again, certainly do not include additional lexemes specifically applicable to boats, i.e. avoid all terms like _sail_.\n\n"
167,tail,1220,TAIL,The appendage of an animal that is attached to its posterior and near the anus.,"##### Illustrative Context\n_The dog wagged its **tail**._\n\n##### Target Sense\n* The most generic noun for a tail as a part of the body of an animal.\n* The lexeme entered must be the default lexeme in the basic vocabulary that would be used in the prototypical case of a flexible tail, and applicable to the various tail types of at least several different types of animal, typically including most quadruped mammals (e.g. dogs, cats, cows, horses, mice) and reptiles (e.g. lizards), birds and (usually) fish.  \n* Enter the generic term for the tail as a whole, as a body part.  Avoid narrower terms for specific types, forms, sizes or parts of a tail.\n* Follow common usage and basic vocabulary.  Strict technical and biological classification criteria are not necessarily relevant — on this, see also the definitions for the separate IE-CoR meanings [wing](../wiki/Meaning:-wing), [snake](../wiki/Meaning:-snake) and [ant](../wiki/Meaning:-ant).  So the exact range of application of the basic lexeme (to different animal species) does not necessarily matter, provided that it is the default lexeme for at least most of the prototypical cases listed above.  Do not, however, enter any additional lexeme that is specific to any narrower uses than the default lexeme.\n* The target sense is the literal body part of an animal.  Do not enter any additional lexemes that predominantly or exclusively refer to figurative extensions of the lexeme _tail_ in English, i.e. any different lexemes for the ‘tail’ of an aircraft, a coat or other garment,a form of hairstyle (e.g. _ponytail_, _pigtail_), or any thin appendage or end part."
171,thick,1244,THICK,Relatively large distance from one surface to the opposite in its smallest solid dimension.,"##### Illustrative Context\n_That tree trunk is **thick**;  it would take a long time cut through._\n\n##### Target Sense\n* The most generic adjective for thick, in the sense of having a relatively large span between opposing sides.  The basic antonym of English _thin_ as applied to things (although not people).   \n* The target sense is the literal one, a dimension of a single object.  As a generic term, the same lexeme may extend to other senses seen as related, but do not enter additional lexemes specific to any of those other senses, such as the following.\n    - Do **not** confuse with the separate IE-CoR meaning [wide](../wiki/Meaning:-wide), i.e. of gaps or spaces rather than objects.\n    - Not density in the sense of the compactness of any material, or a (high) count of individual objects within a (limited) space, in extensions of the English lexeme such as _thick with people_, _thick forest_.  Avoid lexemes that more properly mean _dense_, rather than target _thick_ in some dimension. \n    - Avoid terms referring specifically to liquids, i.e. the extension of the English lexeme to _thick soup_, for example, as the opposite of _runny_.  \n* The target sense is the dimension of an object perceived as primarily horizontal, and certainly not vertical.  Avoid terms that are more equivalent to English _tall, high_ or _deep_ instead of target _thick_.\n* The target context refers to things, including the tree-trunk in the illustrative context, **not** to people (or animals).  Avoid adjectives more specifically applied to people, especially if to refer not to a simple dimension between opposing sides of (a part of) the body (such as an arm or leg), but by default to girth around the stomach, or to general corpulence, e.g. _plump_, _chubby_, _fat_.  \n* The target is a neutral term, relatively free of inherent value judgement as to whether thickness is desirable or not in any given case.  \n* Avoid intensifying or attenuating lexemes, for either especially thick or only slightly thick.\n* The default register term:  avoid lexemes that are markedly elevated or slang.\n* Avoid lexemes that are primarily extensions (e.g. of the English lexeme _thick_) to figurative senses, e.g. obtuse, not intelligent.\n\n\n"

I.e. not the context followed by the conjunction _that_:  _think that_, _believe that_.\n* Avoid intensifying verbs specifically for deep or long thinking:  e.g. _ponder_, _consider_.\n* Avoid verbs focusing on decision-making:  e.g. _decide_.\n* Avoid verbs specifically for superficial thinking, mind-wandering:  e.g. _wonder_.\n\n"
176,three,492,THREE,The natural number three (3).,"##### Illustrative Context\n_**Three** plus one is four._\n\n##### Target Sense\n* The default numeral three, as used when referring to inanimate objects. \n* Avoid the noun form for a group of three, e.g. _threesome_, _trio_, _troika_, or for a ‘number three’ (e.g. a bus).\n* Avoid any different terms used specifically when referring to humans or other animates. \n* Avoid terms specific to counting up or down, if different, e.g. in Irish, or in Russian where the lexeme for IE CoR [one](../wiki/Meaning:-one) is _odin_, not _raz_ (used when counting up).\n\n* In some languages, the same word root for the numeral three can take different grammatical forms.  \n    * In languages that have gender, give the common or masculine form.\n    * In languages that have a contrasting emphatic form, avoid this and give the non-emphatic form.\n\n* See also the target sense definitions for all five lowest numerals covered in IE-CoR:  [one](../wiki/Meaning:-one), [two](../wiki/Meaning:-two), [three](../wiki/Meaning:-three), [four](../wiki/Meaning:-four), [five](../wiki/Meaning:-five)."
177,throw,1456,THROW,"To cause (an object) to move rapidly through the air, with the force of the hand or arm.","##### Illustrative Context\n_**Throw** it so that I can catch it._\n\n##### Target Sense\n* The most basic verb that most naturally pairs with the verb ‘catch’, as in the illustrative context, e.g. English _throw_ or French _lancer_\n* The target sense is that of using the hand to cause something to move through the air, rather than on the ground.  The lexeme entered should be the basic verb that most expresses this contrast with other motion verbs, for which the movement is not through the air, e.g. _push_, _pull_, _roll_.  \n* Some languages may use a rather more general verb, not exclusively for motion through the air, e.g. Italian _tirare_, and/or may clarify that where necessary by explicitly adding phrases such as _in the air_, e.g. Spanish _tirar (al aire)_.  Provided that the verb alone is nonetheless the normal, basic word used for throwing, it should still be selected, as per normal IE-CoR policy to choose the most generic, common verb that also covers the target sense. \n* Avoid verbs that typically carry more specific overtones.  Many languages express these by morphological additions to the basic ‘throw’ verb (e.g. English _throw away_, _throw out_), in which case the basic root _throw_ remains the target lexeme.  But where multiple different verb roots exist, enter the most generic one most free of specific overtones, such as any of the following.\n    - Avoid verbs that imply a specific directional sense, and/or with overtones of throwing in order to strike a target, throwing _at_ (rather than _to_) someone or something, or into water, and so on.  \n    - Avoid verbs with inherent overtones of discarding or disposing of an object, i.e. _throw away_, _throw out_.  \n    - Avoid intensifying verbs for throwing particularly far or hard, or for violent or careless throwing, e.g. _hurl_, _sling_.  \n    - Avoid technical terminology or terminology of throwing specific types of object, e.g. _launch_.  \n    - Avoid non-default register words, such as colloquial English _chuck_, French _balancer_.\n* Some languages, particularly in the Romance family, have multiple close candidate lexemes for ‘throw’, so to determine the most appropriate lexeme in these languages requires targeting precisely the narrower sense described here, and the illustrative context.  French, for example, has two main translation equivalents for ‘throw’, _lancer_ and _jeter_, but the _for me to catch it_ part of the illustrative context identifies _lancer_ as more appropriate (_Lance-le pour que je l’atrappe_, rather than _Jette-le ..._).\n"
178,tie,1917,TIE,To establish connection between two or more things.,"##### Illustrative Context\n_He **tied** the two sticks together._\n\n##### Target Sense\n* The most generic transitive verb for tie in a prototypical case of attaching two things, of roughly the same size, by means of string or rope, with some form of knot.  \n* Enter the default term from basic vocabulary that would be used in that prototypical case, and in the illustrative context.\n* The target sense is that of ‘binding’ by means of string/rope and knots, not that of adherence, e.g. by some form of glue.  Avoid, therefore, terms for which the default meaning is specifically adherence:  e.g. _stick_, _adhere_, French _coller_.\n* Languages differ considerably in their segmentation of this semantic space, and in the precise range of contexts across which the most basic term can be applied.  \n    - English _tie_ is relatively narrowly limited to string/rope and knots, and thus the clear target lexeme in English.\n    - French _attacher_ can be applied more generally, but is nonetheless also the default verb in the target sense and in the illustrative context, where indeed it would by default be taken to mean specifically tie with string and a knot, if not otherwise specified or clear contextually.  As such, _attacher_ is therefore the target lexeme in French.\n* Avoid, however, broader and vaguer terms that would be hypernyms to English _tie_, e.g. _attach_, and whose default interpretation in the illustrative context would **_not_** be that of tying by string and a knot.   This would be the inference, for example, on hearing _He attached the two sticks (together)_ in English.   Given that the more basic term _tie_ is available, highly appropriate and default when using string and knots, where _tie_ is not used, and less basic _attach_ is used instead, the pragmatic implication is that the context must be one where string and knots were not used. \n* Avoid terms that are narrower in that they inherently specify the purpose of the tying, such as to stop an animal (horse, dog, etc.) or imprisoned person from getting free (e.g. English _tie **up**_), to _harness_ or _yoke_  a draught animal to a plough or carriage (e.g. French _atteler_), to tie a saddle on to a horse, etc..\n* Avoid verbs that are narrower in that they take as their object only things of a particular type, such as animals (see above), or boats, e.g. _moor_, French _amarrer_.\n* Avoid verbs that are narrower in that they take as their object the actual strings or knot, rather than the things tied together with those strings, e.g. French _nouer_, or English _knot_ as a verb.\n* Avoid narrower terms for any of various other means of attaching things together, e.g. English _strap_, _clip_, _buckle_, etc..\n* Avoid terms that are narrower in bearing the specific sense of adding a piece onto an existing object, generally a smaller one onto a larger object (an alternative use of English _attach_, for example).\n* Avoid intensifying or attenuating terms that inherently imply that the tying is particularly tight (e.g. English _bind_) or loose.\n* The target sense is the literal one, as in the illustrative context, involving actual strings and sticks.  Do not enter additional lexemes that are predominantly used for figurative extensions of tying, e.g. to express particular closeness, accompaniment, emotional ‘attachment’, constraints, duty, etc.. "
179,tongue,1205,TONGUE,"The flexible muscular organ in the mouth that is used to move food around, for tasting and that is moved into various positions to modify the flow of air from the lungs in order to produce different sounds.","#### Illustrative Context\n_He stuck his **tongue** out._\n\n#### Target Sense\n* The basic term for the tongue as a part of the human body.  \n* The lexeme selected must be applicable to the human tongue.  (It may, and in many languages does apply also to the tongues of animals.)\n* The literal term for the physical body part.  Avoid different terms _specific_ to the sense of taste, to language, and to figurative senses such as somebody's way of speaking (e.g. ‘sharp tongue’).\n* Avoid more technical anatomical or medical terms, if different.\n"
180,tooth,1380,TOOTH,"A hard, calcareous structure present in the mouth of many vertebrate animals (including humans), generally used for eating.","#### Illustrative Context\n_You can break a **tooth** if you bite on hard food._\n\n#### Target Sense\n* The default, most basic and most frequent term for a human tooth.\n* Avoid terms for specific types of tooth, e.g. _incisor_, _molar_, _fang_, etc., and technical, medical terms. \n* Use the generic term for all such types of (human) teeth.  In languages that have no such generic term, but always distinguish front from back teeth (e.g. Basque), or incisors from molars, and so on, then select the most basic lexeme, usually the one for the frontmost teeth.\n\n\n"
181,tree,906,TREE,Any large woody perennial plant with a distinct trunk giving rise to branches or leaves at some distance from the ground.,"##### Illustrative Context\n_There is a **tree** beside the house._\n\n##### Target Sense\n* The most generic noun for a tree in this prototypical sense:  at least large enough to be taller than and able to give shade to a human standing under it;  perennial;  and with a hard, woody trunk.  \n* Languages may differ in how widely applicable their most basic term is to trees of different sizes and types (also according to local species and environment).  The basic lexeme may thus also extend beyond the prototypical case, e.g. in English a banana plant can also be popularly referred to as a ‘tree’.  This is not necessarily a concern:  the target lexeme should simply be the most basic one that would be applicable to the prototypical sense and illustrative context as defined above (and potentially also more broadly).  \n* Follow common usage and basic vocabulary.  Strict technical and biological classification criteria are not relevant — see also the definition for the separate IE-CoR meaning [ant](../wiki/Meaning:-ant).\n* Avoid lexemes that are hypernyms, not specific enough to a tree, e.g. _plant_.\n* Avoid lexemes that are hyponyms, i.e. narrower and more specific in any way, e.g.: \n    - Avoid terms that specifically denote relatively small scale, e.g. _bush_. \n    - Avoid terms that specifically refer to parts rather than the whole of a tree, e.g. _trunk_, _crown_, _wood_. \n    - Avoid terms for general types of tree (e.g. _conifer_), or specific species (e.g. _oak_).\n* If a language has no generic lexeme, and only distinct lexemes for different types of tree (e.g. evergreen vs. deciduous), then enter whichever of those terms is more basic or more common in the local context.  Only if no clear distinction can be made on those grounds, enter the term for the deciduous tree.\n* The term selected should be applicable to a single tree, and will thus normally be a singular noun.  Only in a language where the clearly most basic term is a collective, and where specifying a single tree would require additional singulative morphology, should a collective noun be entered instead.\n* Most languages will have clearly distinct lexemes for this meaning tree, and the separate IE-CoR meaning [forest](../wiki/Meaning:-forest).  Only in few languages might the basic lexeme be the same in both meanings, and distinguished just by additional morphology.\n* Compare with the similar approach to considerations of size in other separate IE-CoR meanings such as [river](../wiki/Meaning:-river), [bird](../wiki/Meaning:-bird) and [leaf](../wiki/Meaning:-leaf).)"
182,turn,1588,TURN,To change the direction of movement or the direction in which something is facing.,"#### Illustrative Context\n_It was heavy so it was hard to **turn** it._\n\n#### Target Sense\n* The most generic transitive verb for turning an object, in the sense of moving it with the result that its orientation changes (relative to some reference point).  \n* Select the most general term:  avoid alternatives or derivatives (e.g. English phrasal verbs) with more specific meanings such as _turn over_, _turn around_, _turn towards_, _orient_.  Although many such derivatives (with similar stems) may be available, select only the default, most general term. \n* Provide the **transitive** verb;  avoid different roots used for intransitives, reflexives, middles, etc.. (Where a language uses the same root for both transitive and other forms, then it is indeed the target term to select.)\n* If a language uses different terms for turning in horizontal and vertical planes, then use the one prototypically for turning in the horizontal plane.\n* Avoid terms specifically for only partial rotation, for complete rotation, or for multiple rotations.  If there is no general cover or ambiguous term, select the one for 90 or 180 degree rotation, whichever is more basic in the language. \n* Avoid more [technical](01--Policy-on-Selecting-Lexemes`#unmarked-default-register-of-everyday-speech) terms, such as _rotate_, _reorient_, _gyrate_, etc..\n* Avoid terms specifically for torsional movement, e.g. _twist_.\n\n\n"
183,two,1498,TWO,The natural number two (2).,"##### Illustrative Context\n_One plus one is **two**._\n\n##### Target Sense\n* The default numeral two, as used when referring to inanimate objects. \n* Avoid the noun for a group of two, e.g. _twosome, _pair_ or _couple_.\n* Avoid any different terms used specifically when referring to humans or other animates. \n* Avoid any different terms used specifically when referring to things that naturally come in pairs:  eyes, hands, etc..  \n* Avoid terms specific to counting up or down, if different.

184,vomit,1278,VOMIT,To regurgitate the contents of the stomach.,"#### Illustrative Context\n_He ate something bad and **vomited**._\n\n#### Target Sense\n* The most generic term for humans vomiting (i.e. regurgitating the contents of the stomach).  Particular attention is needed with register for this meaning:  as per the IE-CoR policy guidelines, target the most neutral register term, neither too formal or euphemistic, nor too informal or vulgar.\n* Note that in some varieties of English,  the most neutral register term is not in fact _vomit_ but, for example _be sick_ (e.g. in the target variety in IE-CoR, namely British English in the lexical usage in England) or _throw up_.\n* Avoid marked higher register terms, e.g. formal or specifically medical ones.\n* Avoid marked euphemisms, unless an original euphemism has lost that connotation and has since become the neutral, direct term.\n* Many languages have multiple informal, slang or vulgar ‘synonyms’:  avoid all such terms. \n* The target lexeme may be morphologically complex in many languages, as for example in Slavic. "
186,hot,1286,HOT,Having a very high temperature.,"##### Illustrative Context\n_The rocks get **hot** during the day and cold at night._  \n\n##### Target Sense\n* The default antonym of [cold](../wiki/Meaning:-cold). \n* The most basic term, typically adjectival, that covers the **largest span** of temperatures higher than neutral, and the **middle ground** of that span of temperatures (within sensible bounds of the usual temperature range in human experience).  \n* This should be a generic, relative term, not a specific and absolute one such as _boiling hot_.\n* Aim for the term covering the broadest range of tactile, ambient and personal uses.\n* Avoid marked, loaded, judgement terms for excessively hot, or not hot enough.\n* Avoid narrow terms limited to specific uses, e.g. hot only of food, only of liquids, only of weather, and so on.\n* Avoid resultative or change of state terms for _made hot_, _heated_.\n* Take the default, unmarked term, i.e. avoid intensifying terms for particularly hot, as well as qualifying, weakening terms such as (only) _warm_. \n* Many languages have just a single obvious default term, but others, particularly in the Germanic languages, have more than one common competing term, as in English _hot_ and _warm_, and their cognates in almost all other Germanic languages.  In English, _hot_ is more in line with the target, and slightly commoner than _warm_, which has a slightly narrower, more specific sense of ‘not especially hot’.  In German, _warm_ is slightly commoner than _heiß_, which has a slightly narrower, more specific sense of ‘particularly hot’.  In a proportion of cases, centered on our target sense, the translational equivalent of English _hot_ is actually often German _warm_.\n\n##### References\n* On the contrasts of tactile vs. ambient in the languages of Vanuatu and in Japanese, see François (2015).  \n* On the contrasts of tactile vs. ambient vs. personal, see Koptjeskaja-Tamm (2011)."
187,wash,1453,WASH,"To remove dirt and grime from an object, using water (usually with soap).","##### Illustrative Context\n_She **washed** her hands._\n\n##### Target Sense\n* The most basic verb for wash in the prototypical sense of cleaning specifically with water.\n* The target sense is thus a hyponym to the vaguer, more general meaning of the English lexeme _clean_, since that is not specific as to whether the cleaning is done with water.  The target lexeme in English is thus only _wash_, and not _clean_.\n* The lexeme entered must at least be applicable in the illustrative context, i.e. a prototypical case of somebody removing dirt from a part of the body, using water (and irrespective of whether any other particular means of cleaning is also used, e.g. soap, a cloth, etc.).  \n* This should be the basic verb root that would be applied to washing part of one’s own body, prototypically one’s hands as in the illustrative context.  Nonetheless, where possible provide just the verb root (or stem) without additional explicitly reflexive morphemes, e.g. French _laver_ rather than _se laver_.  \n* As a generic term, in most languages this lexeme will typically be applicable more widely, e.g. to washing the whole body, someone else’s body, or indeed objects such as clothes, dishes, and so on.  Avoid, however, additional lexemes specific to washing particular types of object.\n* Indeed, avoid any narrower terms more specific in any sense, e.g. _bathe_ (washing specifically by immersion), _rinse_ (washing _off_ with ample water), _wipe_ (with water applied by a cloth), ritual forms of washing or ‘ablution’, animals licking themselves clean, etc..\n\n"

196,wide,1243,WIDE,"Having a long distance or area between two points, especially horizontally.","##### Illustrative Context\n_The canyon is **wide** here, but further down it’s narrow._\n\n##### Target Sense\n* The basic antonym of [narrow](../wiki/Meaning:-narrow) (i.e. of gaps, spaces), **not** the antonym of ‘thin’ (i.e. of objects).  That is, the lexeme entered should be the normal adjective to refer to a (horizontal) **gap** or **space** between two sides, rather than the (horizontal) breadth of an object or person.  \n* If a language has a cover term for both of these senses (gap and objects), then as a basic, general term that is indeed appropriate;  but if there are different terms, choose the more default one for wide gaps, not things.

Even if one of these may be the dominant form of wind for speakers of a given language, the more general term for any type of _wind_ should be entered instead.\n* Some languages may not have a dedicated _wind_ lexeme distinct from _air_.

Avoid narrower terms for specific types, forms, sizes or parts of wings, such as _fin_, _gullwing_, _wingtip_, French _aileron_.\n* Follow common usage and basic vocabulary.  Strict technical and biological classification criteria are not necessarily relevant — on this, see also the definitions for the separate IE-CoR meanings [wing](../wiki/Meaning:-wing), [snake](../wiki/Meaning:-snake) and [ant](../wiki/Meaning:-ant).  So although lexeme entered must be the basic lexeme in the prototypical case as defined above, the exact range of application of the basic lexeme does not necessarily matter.  Many languages extend the same basic term more widely, to include the ‘wings’ of insects, flying mammals (bats, flying foxes, etc.), and the (generally more rudimentary) wings of flightless birds such as chickens or ostriches.  This is not a concern, so long as the basic lexeme entered is also the default lexeme for the prototypical wing here.  Do not, however, enter any additional lexeme that is specific to any such narrower use and not to feathered wings of a flighted bird.\n* The target sense is the literal body part of an animal. Do not enter any additional lexemes that predominantly or exclusively refer to figurative extensions of the lexeme _wing_ in English, e.g. different words for the ‘wings’ of aircraft, buildings, cars, team formations, etc..\n\n"
202,woman,962,WOMAN,An adult human member of the sex that produces ova and bears young.,"#### Illustrative Context\n_I saw a man and a **woman**._\n\n#### Target Sense\n* The most generic term for an adult human female.  \n* In most languages this will be the term that is directly paired with the term for the IE-CoR meaning [man](../wiki/Meaning:-man), in basic phrases such as _man or woman_, _man and woman_, as in the illustrative context.\n* Avoid terms that inherently carry more specific senses of any type:\n    - Avoid terms _specific_ to the place of a woman in a relationship, marriage or kinship.  In many languages, the most basic and generic term is _also_ used as a translation equivalent to English _wife_, e.g. French _femme_, German _Frau_.  This is not an issue; but do not enter terms specific to the sense of _wife_, e.g. French _épouse_.\n    - Avoid specific terms for younger or older women.\n    - Avoid weighted terms that inherently carry honorific or judgmental value:  e.g. _lady_, French _dame_.\n    - Avoid terms that specifically highlight perceived femininity.\n    - Avoid terms that are used to focus more narrowly as explicitly _female_, rather than more equally both female and adult.\n* The neutral-register term:  avoid literary or poetic words, and slang or colloquial terms, e.g. English _dame_, _lass_, etc..\n* See also the IE-CoR meaning [man](../wiki/Meaning:-man)."

204,worm,1219,WORM,A generally tubular invertebrate of the annelid phylum.,"##### Illustrative Context\n_Don’t step on that **worm**._\n\n##### Target Sense\n* The most general term for the worm not as a single specific species but as a general form of animal:  i.e. small, without legs, and which moves by a writhing movement.  \n* Follow common usage and basic vocabulary.  Technical, biological classificatory criteria are not relevant — see also the definition for the separate IE-CoR meaning [ant](../wiki/Meaning:-ant).\n* The lexeme chosen must be applicable to the prototype target case of (earth)worms (of medium size, c. 7 cm.), where this body form is that of the adult.  \n* It _may_ also be extendable to (generally smaller) ‘worms’ as can be found in fruit, such as an apple, in languages such as English where the same basic noun _worm_ can be applied to these as well as to (earth)worms.  \n* Avoid, however, terms specific only to worms in the form of _larvae_ or _maggots_, that refer specifically to a stage in the life-cycle of species whose adult body form is not that of a worm. \n* The lexeme should normally be a singular term.  If the basic term in a language is a collective, in the sense of a mass of worms, then a singulative should be given -- or consider whether this is the appropriate lexeme in any case, especially given the criteria above.\n* Obviously, do not provide words for snakes or other superficially similar animals, nor terms specific to particular types or species of worm, e.g. sandworms, aquatic worms, parasitic worms in humans or other animals, and so on. \n \n"

207,yellow,1424,YELLOW,"Having the colour of a yolk, a lemon or gold.","#### Illustrative Context\n_Egg yolk is **yellow**._\n\n#### Target sense\n* The most basic colour term (usually adjectival) for yellow, as for example would be used to refer to the natural color of egg yolk (as in the illustrative context). \n* Provide only the most basic and general colour term, however, that can also be applied much more widely.  (That is:  do not, of course, give any narrower terms specific to egg yolk, or compounds such as ‘egg-yellow’.)\n* The term entered must belong to basic colour vocabulary in the language.  Avoid all and any near-synonymous but hyponym lexemes, which refer to a narrower colour range than the basic colour term for ‘yellow’, or to sub-shades of it:  e.g. _saffron_, _ochre_. \n* The basic term that covers the illustrative context here may or may not, depending on the language, be distinct from English _orange_.  This is not in itself a concern, provided the other guidelines here are met.\n* Avoid terms specific to other, narrower senses, e.g. specifically for ‘yellow’ hair colour, gold or other metals, the colour of yellow sunlight, etc..\n* The literal colour term.  Avoid lexemes predominantly used for figurative extensions, e.g. _yellow_ as seen as representing cowardice, ill-health, etc..\n* See also the target sense definitions for other colour terms in IE-CoR: [red](../wiki/Meaning:-red), [green](../wiki/Meaning:-green),[black](../wiki/Meaning:-black) and [white](../wiki/Meaning:-white).\n"
208,ant,587,ANT,"Any of the black, red, brown, or yellow insects of the family Formicidae characterized by a large head and by living in organized colonies.","##### Illustrative Context \n_There's an **ant** climbing up your leg._\n\n##### Target Sense\n* General IE-CoR policy is to favour basic, default terms, rather than technical, scientific ones (from biology in this case).  So although technically, in biological classification, _ants_ and _termites_ are quite distinct families, what matters to IE-CoR is that popular usage often does not distinguish them in practice (and focuses instead on their similar form and behaviour as colony insects).  \n* So for this IE-CoR meaning too, provide the most default term in your language:\n    - If the default term covers both ants and termites, then select that term.  This is effectively the case in English, for example, where most speakers take _ant_ as a hypernym, and _termite_ as a hyponym within it (irrespective of the techincal, biolgical classification).  So the correct IE-CoR term in English is indeed _ant_.  Many European languages are similar in this respect.\n    - If your language has no such cover term, but has two distincI, non-overlapping lexemes for _ant_ vs. _termite_, then please select whichever of those is perceived as the more basic, default or common term in your language, whichever of ants or termites it technically refers to.  \n    - Only if you really cannot choose between two equally basic terms, then select the one that refers to the technical _ant_ (i.e. of the family Formicidae) rather than _termite_.\n\n* If your language uses by default a term in the plural, or a non-count noun, enter that default form, and mention this in the notes field."
209,thigh,800,THIGH,The area between the pelvis and buttocks and the knee.,"##### Illustrative Context\n_He slapped his **thigh**._\n\n##### Target Sense\n* The most generic term for the thigh as a part of the human body, i.e. the upper and thicker part of the leg, between the knee and pelvis. \n* In many languages, and as in the illustrative context, the basic term for thigh as a whole can also have a prototypical narrower interpretation, of the ‘front’ of the thigh, upon which one might rest one’s hand.  If (and only if) a language has no single overall term, but only different terms specific to either just the front or just the back of the thigh, then select the term for the front.  Do not enter terms that refer specifically to the back of the thigh, or extend to referring to the buttocks. \n* Give the form applicable to one thigh, as in the illustrative context.  Usually this will of course be the singular form;  avoid any special dual/plural formations.  A dual/plural form should only be given if it is the basic, default form in a given language, which would require additional singulative morphology to refer to just one of the two thighs.\n* Avoid technical medical and anatomical terms, and terms specific to the thigh muscle or bone, e.g. _femur_.\n* In some languages the same basic term may also be applicable to the upper part of the legs of some animals.  Avoid terms specific to other animals, however, and which are not the default word for the human thigh.\n* See also the definitions of the separate IE-CoR meanings [knee](../wiki/Meaning:-knee), [mouth](../wiki/Meaning:-mouth), [neck](../wiki/Meaning:-neck) and [hand](../wiki/Meaning:-hand).\n"
210,navel,1838,NAVEL,A scar where the umbilical cord was attached.,"##### Illustrative Context\n_You could see his **navel**._\n\n##### Target Sense\n* The default term for the navel or ‘belly-button’ (i.e. where the umbilical cord was once attached) as a part of the human body.\n* Enter the most normal, basic term in the language.\n    - Avoid lexemes that are higher-register, technical or medical terms, e.g. English (!) _umbilicus_.\n    - Avoid terms that are perceived as predominantly ‘baby-talk’ or unmistakably slang terms.  \n* In many languages there is an obvious straightforward term, e.g. French _nombril_, German _(Bauch)Nabel_.  In many varieties of English, however, there is in fact a difficult choice between higher-register _navel_ and colloquial register alternatives such as _belly-button_.  In the variety of (British) English targeted in IE-CoR, _belly-button_ is in fact selected as the more neutral, basic term on several IE-CoR criteria.  The term _navel_ is perceived as more markedly high-register than _belly-button_ is low-register.  Furthermore, the lexeme _navel_ is not part of the basic, early vocabulary of native learners, and is generally not acquired until relatively late.\n* Provide the basic term for the actual part of the human body. \n Avoid lexemes that predominantly carry figurative senses of origin, centre point, focal point or even rotation point, e.g. _navel of the world_.\n* As ever, etymology and congacy should **not** be a criterion in lexeme selection.  This is strict IE-CoR protocol in all cases, but re-emphasised here given the potential temptation with some of the Indo-European roots involved.  Lexeme determination should be guided by semantics, not etymology, and by the standard IE-CoR selection criteria.  \n\n"

Follow common usage in the language, not biological classification.\n* In a language which has no single overarching term, select the common term for the housefly or face fly (or closest local equivalent): typically black, mid-sized, and with no bite.\n* Avoid terms limited to species with more specific and distinctive characteristics:  biting flies (e.g. sandflies, midges, mosquitos), particularly small (e.g. fruit flies), or particularly big (e.g. horseflies), and so on.\n* Avoid collective terms.\n\n\n"
212,yesterday,1174,YESTERDAY,The day before today.,"#### Illustrative Context\n_I haven't seen him today but I did see him **yesterday**._\n\n#### Target Sense\n* Term used for the day before today, e.g. French _hier_.  \n* **Not** ‘the day before’ any other day (not deictic today) taken as the point of reference, e.g. French _la veille_, etc.. \n\n"
213,shadow,2275,SHADOW,"Darkness, where light (particularly sunlight) is blocked.","##### Illustrative Context\n_He could see his **shadow** on the ground._\n\n##### Target Sense\n* The generic term for shadow, as would be the default lexeme for the prototypical case of a person’s shadow, as cast by the sun during the day.  \n* As a generic term, in many languages (as in English) the same lexeme is also the default term much more widely:  for the ‘shadows’ of animals or any object, and from any light source.  Do not, however, enter additional lexemes specific to any such contexts.\n* The target sense is the one specific to English (a) _shadow_ as opposed to _shade_.  That is, the lexeme entered must be the default term for a _shadow_ as a particular defined shape, in two dimensions, from which it may even be possible to identify who or what cast that shadow.  The target is not, then, the specific sense of _shade_ as relief from the heat or brightness of the sun, as cast normally by a  tree, building, rock, etc., usually bigger than a person.  The target lexeme will thus also normally be a count noun like _shadow_, able to be applied to a specific shadow of a single person, rather than a non-count noun like _shade_.\n* In many languages, however, the same default lexeme is a cover term for both _shadow_ and _shade_, e.g. French _ombre_.  If so, then that is indeed the target lexeme for that language, as the basic vocabulary term that (also) covers the target sense here (irrespective of wider meaning extensions).  Do not, however, enter additional lexemes specific to the alternative sense of English _shade_.\n* Avoid looser, more ambiguous terms, e.g. for _darkness_ in general.\n* Avoid narrower terms such as _outline_ or _silhouette_.\n* The target sense is the literal one that comes from blocking out a light source.  Do not enter any additional terms that may be figurative extensions, e.g. as some essence of the person that casts it, their soul, spirit, self, or a much weakened state, etc..\n \n\n"
214,house,1252,HOUSE,"The abode of a human being, their place of residence.","##### Illustrative Context\n_His **house** is at the edge of the village._\n\n##### Target Sense\n* The most generic term for a house in the prototypical sense of a fixed structure, above ground, where people (especially a family) habitually live, and usually sleep overnight.  Seen in contrast to buildings of other types and for other purposes, e.g. school, church, train station, etc..\n* The term entered should be the default one that would be used in the prototypical context of a single, free-standing house which in many cultures would be where one family or ‘household’ lives independently.  Do not enter terms such as _apartment_, _flat_ (or even _room_), that explicitly refer to only parts of a (typically larger) building, in which multiple different families or ‘households’ each have their separate living spaces. \n* The target term in English is only _house_ (for living in), not the vaguer hypernym _building_ (of any type or for any function).  Do not enter an equivalent to _building_.  Only in a language where a single lexeme is the default term in both scopes — i.e. either specific _house_ or the looser extension to _building_ — should that dual term be entered, e.g. Russian _дом/dom_.\n* The target sense is the literal, neutral one of the physical building, as seen objectively by anyone, and not from the subjective perspective of the person who lives there.  That is, the target term in English is only _house_, and definitely not _home_, because that conveys additional and more specific (or figurative) senses:  of attachment, belonging, identity, origin or return (as in _homeland_).  Again, some languages may use (variants of) the same term for both English lexemes, but do not enter any additional lexeme more akin to English _home_.  \n* Enter only the default, generic term for house as defined above.  Avoid narrower terms specific to any particular type of house, e.g. _hut_, _cottage_, etc..\n* Enter the neutral term in basic vocabulary:  avoid lexemes with additional connotations and value judgements, e.g. _mansion_, _hovel_.\n* Avoid terms specific to either markedly elevated or lower registers, e.g. _abode_, _dwelling_, _pad_, French _demeure_ or French slang _baraque_.\n* Avoid terms specific to figurative extensions of the English lexeme _house_, e.g. lineage, family, full set, school class, etc..\n"
215,bitter,887,BITTER,Having an acrid taste.,"##### Illustrative Context\n_The leaves tasted **bitter**._\n\n##### Target Sense\n* Most generic term, typically adjectival, for a (not pleasant) bitter **taste**.\n* Avoid terms meaning _sour_, or other unpleasant tastes.\n* Avoid terms specifically for other, especially figurative, sub-senses of the English lexeme _bitter_ (e.g. _a bitter defeat_, _lesson_, _weather_, etc.), and which do not refer to taste.\n"
216,hard,1884,HARD,Resistant to pressure.,"##### Illustrative Context\n_It was very **hard**.  When he bit it he broke his tooth._\n\n##### Target Sense\n* The most generic adjective for hard as the basic antonym of soft.\n* The target sense is the literal one of a solid object resistant to being cut, damaged or compressed.  \n* Beware of the common extension from (literally) ‘hard’ to the sense of ‘difficult’, as in the polysemy of the English lexeme _hard_.  This is not necessarily an issue in a language that shares the same extension as English, provided that the lexeme in question remains the default term in basic vocabulary also for the literal resistance of a solid object.  So the target lexeme in French is _dur_, which also has both senses (literal ‘hard’ as well as ‘difficult’).  Avoid, however, terms that apply predominantly to the extension sense of ‘difficult’.  The target lexeme in German is therefore not _schwer_ (‘difficult’), but literal _hart_.\n* Avoid more morphologically complex terms that add an explicit sense of change of state, i.e. terms literally equivalent to _hardened_, except when a lexeme is only etymologically complex, and has lost that originally change of state sense to become the default adjective in the basic vocabulary.\n* The target sense is the literal, neutral one of _hard_ of a solid object.  Avoid additional lexemes that are primarily figurative extensions and/or value judgements, e.g. _uncompromising_, _strict_, _unfeeling_, _unbreakable_, _tough_. \n* Avoid intensifying (or qualifying) terms for especially hard, or narrower terms for hard in one particular sense or dimension, e.g. _rigid_, _unbending_.\n* The neutral register term from the basic vocabulary:  avoid colloquial, technical or more elevated terms, e.g. _resistant_, _rigid_, etc.."
217,sweet,717,SWEET,Having the taste characteristic of sugar or honey.,"##### Illustrative Context\n_This apple is ripe now, it tastes **sweet**._\n\n##### Target Sense\n* The most generic adjective for sweet in the literal sense of the type of taste, prototypically that of sugar, most fruits, or honey.  \n* In most languages the target lexeme will be one of a reduced core set of adjectives for basic taste types, e.g. _sweet_ as opposed to _sour_, _salty/_savoury_ and _bitter_.  Indeed, in many languages the target lexeme will be the one used specifically in common two-way contrast expressions such as _sweet and sour_ or _sweet or savoury_.\n* The target is the adjectival meaning _sweet_, not the noun _sugar_.  In most cases, avoid narrower adjectives derived from the sugar noun, e.g. _sugary_, or indeed from its equivalent verb for putting sugar on/into food (_sugared_), except if such a derived form has lost its unique relationship to the noun _sugar_, and become the default word in basic vocabulary for _sweet_ in any context.  So while most Romance languages, for example, retain cognates of Latin _dulcis_ as their basic lexeme, e.g. Italian _dolce_ and Spanish _dulce_, the cognate in French (_doux_) has shifted to mean _soft_, and in its place the derived adjective _sucré_ has become the default term for this IE-CoR meaning ‘sweet’.\n* The target sense is the literal one of the type of taste, of foods that are eaten.  Avoid additional lexemes that are predominantly extensions to figurative and emotional senses of the English lexeme _sweet_, e.g. for endearment, character type, goodness, pleasure, etc..  \n* The term in the basic vocabulary, of neutral register.  Avoid technical culinary or scientific terms, e.g. _sucrose_.\n\n"
218,go,695,GO,To get from one place to another by any means.,"##### Illustrative Context\n_I saw him on the road. I don't know where he was **going**._\n\n##### Target Sense\n* The most basic, intransitive verb for changing location from one place to another place.  Often this will be the verb used in very generic expressions like ‘going from A to B’.  Note that this meaning is specifically **not** the sense of [walk](../wiki/Meaning:-walk). \n* The priority is to select the most basic word that meets the definitions here.  This will be one of the commonest verbs in the language (and one of the first that a foreign learner would need to know).  In many languages it is easy to identify:  e.g. _go_, _aller_, _ir_.  (This frequency also means that your language's verb may be **suppletive**.  If so, then please see [below](../wiki/Meaning:-go#suppletive-forms) for the special policy needed for which form(s) to enter.)  \n* On the other hand, many languages do not have a single generic verb corresponding to all of the broad scope of the English verb _go_, so particular care is needed to follow the specifications given here.  \n* Although most typically for ground travel by foot, in many languages the basic term is general enough to apply to various modes within a single ‘going’ from A to B.  (English _go_ can also cover a journey involving many different modes, even swimming, flying, etc.).   Nonetheless, always recall the criterion **basic**: do not select rare or technical words, just because they are carefully ambiguous between all possible modes:  so English _go_, not _move_, _travel_, etc..  \n* In many languages the most general ‘go’ verb is still transparently based on the more specific sense of going by foot, e.g. Italian _andare_ (from Latin _ambulare_).  Such a verb can and should be selected, provided that its semantic range has spread to become also the more general ‘go’, cover sense too.  On the other hand, avoid terms that _specifically_ and _exclusively_ mean going by foot, such as _walk_ or Italian _camminare_ (which has effectively moved into the more specific semantic slot once occupied by _ambulare_).  \n* The basic target sense is for movement by people, although the preferred generic word will often be applicable to animals too, or in some languages (like English _go_) also by vehicles.\n* The basic target sense is for people moving by themselves (typically walking).  So the verb selected should certainly not be one that exclusively refers to people travelling in vehicles and/or riding on animals.  So German _fahren_ is not to be selected, and _gehen_ instead.  \n* Prototypically the target sense is for deliberate movement, targeting the destination.  Avoid words that specifically mean non-targeted, multi-directional movement for the sake of the movement, rather than destination, e.g. avoid terms like _wander_, _amble_, _go for a walk_.\n* Prototypically the target sense is for covering some significant distance, not just adjusting position (_move_).  Also avoid words specifically for long distances that could only viably be covered in some vehicle.\n* Avoid any overly specific meanings, such as terms that emphasise speed (e.g. _run_), distance, and so on.\n* Do not consider grammatical uses of _go_-like words, such as progressive or future auxiliaries, inchoative verbs, etc..  \n\n##### Suppletive Forms!\nIt is particularly common that this verb is suppletive in Indo-European languages, and a very specific policy has to be adopted in this case.  Provide first the standard citation form in the language (often the infinitive).  However, if the third person singular present form uses a different root, then enter that too, separated by the ≠ character, as in the following examples for Romance languages:\n* French:   `aller ≠ va`\n* Italian:  `andare ≠ va`\n* Spanish:  `ir ≠ va`  \n\nFor more details, see the guidance/help page on [how to deal with suppletion](../wiki/01--Policy-on-Verbal-Forms#dealing-with-verbal-suppletion)."
219,run,1519,RUN,To move quickly by alternately making a short jump off of either foot.,"##### Illustrative Context\n_Can you **run** fast?_\n\n##### Target Sense\n* The most generic intransitive verb for going faster on foot than merely walking. (I.e. both feet will be off the ground at some point while _running_, but not when _walking_.)\n    - Avoid intensive terms, specific to running very fast or as fast as possible. \n    - Avoid terms specifically for animals, where different.\n    - Avoid terms with further, specific connotations, e.g. _jog_ as specifically running for the purpose of exercise.\n* Beware the polysemy of the English lexeme _run_:\n    - Avoid terms for flowing or other movement of e.g. liquids, where different.\n    - Avoid terms referring specifically to the ‘running’ of moving parts of machines.\n    - Avoid terms that specifically mean ‘function’, ‘manage’, etc..\n\n"
220,carry,700,CARRY,To lift and bring to somewhere else; to transport by lifting.,"##### Illustrative Context\n_She **carried** her bag (under her arm)._\n\n##### Target Sense\n* The most generic transitive verb, prototypically for people carrying a load while walking, and which must be applicable in that context.\n* The term should be generic, free of more precise connotations as to the purpose of the carrying.  That is, avoid terms such as _bring_ or _deliver_.\n* Some languages distinguish multiple different verbs for different ways of carrying:  e.g. in the hand, over the shoulder, on the back.  In such cases, select whichever term is the least marked and specific, able to be used when the particular manner of carrying is unknown or unimportant.  Only where a language has no unmarked term, select the term for carrying under the arm (the most stable sub-meaning according to the World Loanword Database).\n* The term should be a literal one.  Avoid terms that are specifically or predominantly figurative, e.g. _bear_ a burden.\n* Avoid terms for wearing clothes, unless also the basic carry word in a language, e.g. French _porter_.\n* Avoid terms for simply holding something (up), without actually moving with it.\n"
221,take,1749,TAKE,To grasp with the hands.,"#### Illustrative Context\n_**Take** the money when you go._\n\n#### Target Sense\n* This is a complex semantic field, in which the English lexeme _take_ and its translation equivalents in many languages may cover many overlapping sub-senses.  \n* The IE-CoR target sense, as in the illustrative context, is that of moving an object by having it with you as you yourself move.  Typically this comes in natural combination with reference also to the necessary initial act of first taking that object into your ‘possession’ (whether temporary or permanent). \n\n* Select the most basic verb, which will typically be generic enough to cover both of these aspects together by default (even if it pragmatically, in appropriate contexts, it may also be interpretable as focused on just one of those two senses).  So in practice:\n    - Avoid lexemes inherently more narrowly restricted to or focused on the prerequisite act of removal, taking _away_ or taking possession (e.g. _grab_, _seize_), without also including the sense of moving (with) that object further.  \n    - Likewise, avoid lexemes inherently more narrowly restricted to the sense of just having an object with you as you move (e.g. _carry_, _bear_, _have on you_), without also including the sense of first taking possession of it. \n\n* The meaning here is not _carry_.  That is:  avoid lexemes that are more narrowly focused on a particular physical means by which an object is moved e.g. English _carry_, French _porter_, German _tragen_.\n* The meaning here is not _bring_.  That is:  the term selected should ideally be generic also in the sense of not being narrowly deictic and not focused on a particular direction of movement, e.g. French _prendre_ not _emporter_ nor _apporter_.  \n* Some languages may not have a basic generic cover-term lexeme, but only multiple narrower and explicitly deictic and directional verbs.  In such cases only, then select the verb with the deictic sense of _taking away from_ rather than _bringing towards_ the deictic reference point.  As in English, the most neutral verb may in appropriate contexts also allow of a more specific directional sense (usually the _away from_ direction, given the definition here).  This is not an issue so long as that basic lexeme is also used in deixis-free contexts.  In most English varieties, for example, if the deictic reference point is A, then one _takes_ from A to B, one _brings_ from B to A, but decisive for the IE-CoR definition is that one also  _takes_ (not _brings_) from B to C, where neither place is the deictic reference point.  \n* The lexeme selected must be applicable to objects small enough to be picked up and carried in the hand, as in the illustrative context.  It may also be applicable to larger objects, and indeed to _taking_ people and animals, in the sense of leading or even carrying them (e.g. for babies).  Do not, however, select a verb that is specific to _taking_ only people or animals (e.g. French _amener_, _emmener_), or specific to the sense of _lead_.\n* The lexeme selected must be applicable to things that can be taken in the hand, and moved by the person walking.  In many languages (including English) the most basic term may also cover _taking_ by vehicle.  In languages that have different verbs for taking by walking or by vehicle (as in many Slavic languages), do not select a verb that is specific to leading or _taking_ by vehicle.\n* Select the most neutral and generic lexeme, without any other additional meaning specification (wherever possible).  \n    - Avoid intensifying terms that emphasise the speed (or slowness) of taking possession, or the speed of movement with the thing taken.\n    - Avoid terms that emphasise the abruptness or force of taking possession:  e.g. _grab_, _seize_.\n    - Avoid terms that refer also to ownership or to the _taking_ as specifically temporary or permanent.  Especially avoid terms specific to the sense of _steal_. \n\n* On a morphological level, too, the most basic, neutral and generic lexeme will usually have the least additional morphology that might add more specific meaning specifications.  Within this semantic field, many languages have multiple derivational variants based around a basic root, e.g. English _take+away_ and German _mit+nehmen_.  Normally, if such morphology is still transparent, then enter the basic form of the lexeme, without additional morphemes.  So the lexeme in English is just plain _take_, in German just plain _nehmen_.  \n* Nonetheless, _deep_ etymology is not relevant.  Original additional morphology can become fused and lose its original specifying sense, and/or an original bare root may no longer exist alone.  French _prendre_ is the basic and correct term in this meaning, as it has long since been reanalysed as a single root morpheme, even if ultimately derived with an original Latin prefix _pre-_. \n\n\n\n"
222,hide,602,HIDE (CONCEAL),To put something in a place where it will be harder to discover or out of sight.,"##### Illustrative Context\n_They **hid** their food from the animal._\n\n##### Disambiguation\nThe verb _(to) hide_ (from view), not the noun for an animal skin.\n\n##### Target Sense\n* The most generic transitive verb for hide in the sense of placing an object out of sight, to make it difficult to find.\n* The target form is the transitive one, as in the illustrative context, and should be applicable to hiding an object such as a mid-sized fruit (e.g. an apple).  Avoid intransitive forms (if different), or forms with additional middle voice or reflexive morphology, i.e. in French the target lexeme is just _cacher_, not _se cacher_.\n* Enter the most generic term:  avoid lexemes with narrower senses of any kind, including particular ways of hiding, e.g. _camouflage_, _screen_, _bury_, _cloak_.  \n* The target sense is the literal one, of hiding an object out of sight.  Avoid any different lexemes with predominantly figurative senses, such as for ‘hiding’ emotions, thoughts, plans, or misleading in other ways, e.g. _dissimulate_.\n* The default register term.  Avoid lexemes specific to other registers, e.g. formal or literary (_conceal_, _secrete_) or slang (e.g. French _planquer_).\n\n"
223,cry,1839,CRY,To shed tears due to the impact of an emotion.,"##### Illustrative Context\n_She was **crying** when I saw her._\n\n##### Disambiguation\n* Beware the ambiguity of the English lexeme _cry_.  The sense targeted here is the basic meaning of the bare root _cry_ in modern spoken English, i.e. _cry_ as _shed tears_.  \n* Do **not** consider the sense of _cry (out)_ as _shout_.  Usage of the bare root _cry_ — i.e. unsupported by _out_, _aloud_, etc. — is increasingly rare in this sense, except in the written register.\n\n##### Target Sense\n* The most generic verb for people shedding tears.\n* By default the context will be one of strong emotion, prototypically sadness but also pain or joy.  \n* Avoid terms for accompanying emotions but which do not specifically mean shedding tears, e.g. _lament_, _bewail_.\n* Avoid terms, if different, simply for physiological reactions of the eye, unconnected with emotion, e.g. _eyes watering_.\n"
224,do,813,DO,To perform an action.,"##### Illustrative Context\n_What did you **do** in the village yesterday?_\n\n##### Target Sense\n* The most generic verb for carrying out an activity or action.\n* The basic meaning should be just of performing an activity, not for creating an object which _results_ from the activity.  So avoid terms like English _make_, which have specifically that sense, in opposition to a more general _do_ word.  Note that in German, however, the cognate word _machen_ is now also a generic _do_ word, not specific to making objects, and therefore does fit the target sense here.\n* Avoid auxiliaries if they have a different form to the main content verb.\n\n"
225,grind,1033,GRIND,"To break something into small pieces by pressing it flat, or grinding it to powder.","##### Illustrative Context\n_He is **grinding** the nuts._\n\n##### Target Sense\n* The most generic transitive verb for grinding, in the following prototypical sense and context:  to break up a hard, dry substance, particularly foodstuffs such as nuts, seeds or beans (e.g. coffee), into powdery or granular form, by a crushing, rotating action with a hard implement, typically stone (or metal) .  The lexeme selected must be the basic term used in this prototypical case, although it may also be applicable more widely across other similar contexts.\n* In many languages the same basic lexeme is used for turning cereal grains into flour.  Where a language has a different lexeme specific to this case, however, then do not provide this narrower lexeme, but the more general one.  So in English the correct English lexeme is thus more general _grind_, not narrower _mill_.\n* In many languages an adjectival form derived from the same verb is used to describe the result:  e.g. English _grind_ -> _ground_ (e.g. nuts, almonds, coffee);  French _moudre_ -> _moulu_;  German _mahlen_ -> _gemahlen_, etc..\n* Avoid terms such as _mash_ or _pulp_ that refer to similar actions, but with moist or wet substances.\n* Avoid terms such as _pound_ or _stamp_ that imply repeated directional blows, rather than the crushing, rotating movement of ‘grind’.\n* Avoid terms such as _squeeze_, _crush_, that focus on prolonged pressure, rather than the process of reducing to granular form.\n* Avoid intensifying terms with a specific emphasis on the desintegration or destruction, or that imply using particular force, e.g. German _zermalmen_. \n* Avoid terms that focus on a ‘grinding’ _noise_, of hard objects in contact and friction, e.g. of brakes, teeth, etc..\n"
226,claw,72,CLAW,"The hard, keratin part growing at the feet of animals.","##### Illustrative Context\n_The cat scratched me with its **claws**._\n\n##### Target Sense\n* The most generic term for the sharp, pointed, curved and horny body-part at the end of the toes of an animal.  As a prototypical case, take the claws of an animal like a cat (except if a language happens to have a narrow term specific to the claws of a cat, in which case select whatever other term is most generic).  \n* In many languages, the generic term is also applicable to a bird’s claws.  Nonetheless, the target sense here is the hard, inflexible and already curved body-part at the end of the toe, that can scratch or snag on a surface (like a cat’s claws).  Do not confuse this with (nor select) words that have more the sense of _talons_ (e.g. of a bird of prey), that can refer to the whole set of toes that can physically grab, grasp, grip and hold an object (a branch, or prey) by muscles.  \n* Some languages have the same basic lexeme for both IE-CoR meanings ‘claw’ and [nail](../wiki/nail), without generally making a distinction between them.  In such cases then that same term should be entered for both meanings in that language.\n* However, if a language does, like English, have a (common register) distinction between the largely flat, protective covering _nail_ on human fingers, versus the curved, pointed _claw_ on the toes of an animal like a cat, then select the latter here, in contrast to the entry for [nail](../wiki/Meaning:-nail).  \n* In some languages, the basic word tends to be used more (or even exclusively) in the plural, e.g. Spanish _garras_, even to an extent English _claws_ itself.  If distinctly more natural in your language, simply enter the plural form.  (The key interest in IE-CoR is in the cognacy status of the root used in the target meaning, not in the morphology of singular vs. plural.)  \n\n"

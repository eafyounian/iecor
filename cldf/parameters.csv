4,ash,646,ASH,The incombustible matter remaining after a substance has been incinerated.,"##### Illustrative Context\n_There was nothing left but **ash**._\n\n##### Disambiguation\nBeware the ambiguity of English _ash_.  The meaning here is _ash_ as the remains of burnt materials, **not** the tree species _ash_.\n\n##### Target Sense\n* Ash as the generic word for the powdery remains from burning many materials, such as wood, grass or dry dung.\n* The lexeme must be applicable to **cold** ash.  Avoid words that refer specifically to still hot _embers_.\n* The lexeme must be applicable to ash as reduced to **powder**.  Avoid words that can refer to material not fully burnt and still solid, objects that are merely charred or blackened.\n* The lexeme must be applicable to ash that is **white/grey** in colour, and not just charred black _soot_. \n* The generic term for the **substance**.  In many languages this will be a mass/non-count noun, as in English ‘singular’ _ash_ or French _(la) cendre_.  In such cases, provide this mass or ‘singular’ form, especially if plural forms have more specific senses, such as _ash**es**_ or _(les) cendre**s**_ — see the next bullet point.\n* Avoid words with the specific sense of the burnt remains of a particular thing, or indeed a body, and/or the results of a deliberate act of cremation, e.g. Russian _прах_ or the usage of the plural _ash**es**_ in English.\n "
6,back,1291,BACK,"The rear of body, especially the part between the neck and the end of the spine and opposite the chest and belly.","#### Illustrative Context\n_I fell over and now my **back** hurts._\n\n#### Disambiguation\nBeware the polysemy of English _back_.  The meaning intended here is the noun for the **part of the human body**, not the reverse side of an object, nor the adverb as in _go back_, _put it back_.\n\n#### Target Sense\n* The most generic term for the ‘back’ as a part of the human body.  \n* The term should be able to refer to the whole back, from the shoulders to the hips. \n* In many languages, such as English, the lexeme in this target sense (_back_) can also be applied more widely, e.g. on _horseback_ or the _back of the house_.  In such languages, this remains the correct lexeme to select, since it is also the basic term for the target sense.  \n* Avoid, however, terms that refer _specifically_ to the ‘back’ of an animal or the reverse side of an object, if different from the basic word for the human back.\n* Avoid terms specific to the sense of the weight-bearing part of the body for carrying.  In particular, avoid terms that mean specifically _shoulders_. \n* Avoid narrower terms specific to only one part of the back, e.g. equivalent either to English _upper back_ or _lower back_ only.\n* If a language has two distinct lexemes for the upper vs. lower back specifically, but no generic lexeme applicable to the whole back, then select the term considered the more basic and commoner of the two.  Only if no such judgement seems justifiable, then select the term for the upper back."
7,bad,1292,BAD,Not good; unfavorable; negative.,"#### Illustrative Context\n_That isn’t a good idea, it’s a **bad** idea._\n\n#### Target Sense\n* The most generic, default, unmarked adjective for negative judgement, as an antonym of [good](/wiki/Meaning:-good).  \n* The target sense is a general judgement of negative, i.e. deleterious or inappropriate in the current context.  \nBeware the wide polysemy of the English word _bad_.  \n* Avoid terms specific to the sense of _morally_ wrong or _evil_.  There is no necessary implication of this in the IE-CoR target sense of ‘bad’.\n* Avoid terms for other specific sub-senses of English ‘bad’, e.g. words that mean specifically ‘rotten’, ‘angry’, etc.. \n* Avoid marked, intensifying words, such as _terrible_, _horrible_.\n* Some languages may not have a straightforward candidate lexeme for this target sense.  In such cases, as well as the illustrative context given above, consider also which term for ‘bad’ works well in a wider variety of usage contexts. \n* Occasional languages (e.g. Cuzco Quechua) may even lack a default generic adjective for ‘bad’, and instead use just a negation of their lexeme for ‘good’.  It is possible to enter this ‘not good’ combination as the lexeme for this meaning, but only in languages where there is no viable simple adjective for negative judgement."
8,bark,1204,BARK,The exterior covering of the trunk and branches of a tree.,"##### Illustrative Context\n_He tore some **bark** off the tree._\n\n##### Disambiguation\nThe noun for the bark (outer layer) of a tree, **not** the verb (or noun) for the sound made by a dog!\n\n##### Target Sense\n* The most basic, generic term for the outermost layer(s) of the trunk and branches of a tree or shrub, often relatively easily stripped off. \n* Avoid technical terms from botany.  Base your lexeme determination on common usage, not on botanical nomenclature\nand classification.  Select the most basic, generic term that includes the outermost layer, even if that popular usage may also include other immediately underlying layers as strictly defined in botany.  \n* Avoid terms that mean specifically _cork_ — technically only part of the bark, and not the outermost layer — or any other sub-layer.\n* Avoid terms specific to particular uses of bark, or parts of it, e.g. _cork_.\n* Avoid terms specific to particular types of bark, or the bark of particular types of tree.\n\n\n"
10,belly,1251,BELLY,"The lower part of the front of the torso (or a comparable part of an animal), confined by the upper side by the midriff and the lowerside by the pelvis. Contains the intestines.","#### Illustrative Context\n_He punched him in the **belly**._\n\n#### Target Sense\nThe front part of the human body below the rib-cage/chest and above the pelvis.\n\n* Avoid more loaded terms with specific overtones, such as size or protrusion, e.g. _paunch_, _pot belly_.\n* Avoid higher register terms, e.g. scientific or medical terms such as _abdomen_.\n* Avoid nursery-register terms such as _tummy_.\n* Avoid terms *specific* to internal organs.  Only in cases where a lexeme that originally referred to an internal organ has since extended semantically to become the default register word also (ambiguously) for the target sense here, would that lexeme be the correct selection.  An example is that in some varieties of English, _stomach_ has indeed now become the (ambiguous) default term for this meaning.\n "
11,big,1202,BIG,Of a great size; the weakest sense of great size.,"##### Illustrative Context\n_This is a **big** stone. That is a small stone._\n\n##### Target Sense\n* The most generic term, typically adjectival, for large size in an unspecified dimension.  The basic, default antonym of [small](/wiki/Meaning:-small).  \n* The basic term will generally be applicable very widely, but must be applicable at least to inanimate objects.  Avoid terms used only or predominantly to refer to people.\n* Avoid terms specific to a particular dimension like height, width or girth:  i.e. avoid terms such as _tall_, _wide_ or _fat_.  \n* Avoid intensifying terms that stress especially big, e.g. _huge_, _vast_, _enormous_.\n* Enter the most basic, neutral term.  Avoid lexemes with any inherent value judgement of any form, e.g. _great_, _grand_.\n* See also the definition for the IE-CoR meaning [small](../wiki/Meaning:-small).  \n"
12,bird,937,BIRD,"Any of the bipedal, warm-blooded vertebrates that lay eggs having wings which, for most species, enables them to fly.","#### Illustrative Context\n_What **bird** does this feather come from?_\n\n#### Target Sense\n* The most basic, generic term to refer to birds.  \n* The generic lexeme selected must be able to refer to a flighted bird of medium size, for example a common (Eurasian) blackbird — but obviously must not be the specific name of that or any other individual bird species.\n* In languages that have no single generic term, but separate terms by size, select the term for birds of that medium (blackbird) size.  \n* Avoid terms _specific_ to particularly small or particularly large species of bird.\n* Avoid terms specific to particular types of bird, such as birds of prey, e.g. _raptor_.  \n* Avoid terms specific to domesticated or hunted birds, e.g. _fowl_.\n* Avoid technical, biological terminology, e.g. _avian_.\n"
13,bite,1403,BITE,Clamping the teeth hard on something.,"##### Illustrative Context\n_The dog **bit** him._\n\n##### Target Sense\n* Most generic transitive verb for biting with the teeth, avoiding any terms with more limited and specific senses.\n* Avoid terms specific to the ‘bite’ (or sting) of insects, snakes, etc..\n* Avoid terms for prolonged, repeated biting or masticating with the teeth, e.g. _gnaw_, _chew_, _chomp_, etc..\n* Avoid terms that imply _continuing_ to grasp or hold on to with the teeth.\n* Avoid terms specifically meaning to cut or tear away with the teeth, i.e. _bite **off**_.\n* Avoid terms with any other narrower senses or usage, e.g. specifically for biting food, or indeed for biting people.\n\n"
14,black,163,BLACK,Dark and colourless; not reflecting visible light.,"#### Illustrative Context\n_Charcoal is **black**._\n\n#### Target Sense\n* The most basic colour term (usually adjectival) seen as the natural antonym of [white](../wiki/Meaning:-white).\n* Avoid terms meaning _dark_ (absence of (day)light), _dirty_ or _burnt_.\n* Avoid terms limited to figurative senses such as _bleak_, _depressing_.\n* Give only the most basic colour term:  avoid near-synonymous terms based on specific things (especially nouns!) that are prototypically black in colour:  e.g. _soot_, ebony_, _jet_.\n* Avoid intensifying terms or compounds used to stress _totally_ or _completely_ black, e.g. _pitch black_. "
15,blood,946,BLOOD,A fluid connective tissue consisting of the plasma and cells that circulate in the blood vessels.,"##### Illustrative Context\n_**Blood** is red._\n\n##### Target Sense\n* The most generic term for blood, which must be able to be applied specifically to human blood as running fresh from a cut to the skin.  (In most languages the basic generic term will also be applicable to the blood of many animals.) \n* Select only the basic, default register term:  avoid technical, medical terms.\n* Avoid loaded or emotive terms, e.g. English _gore_ or Latin _cruor_ rather than basic _sanguis_.\n* Avoid words only or predominantly used in figurative senses of ‘blood’ as ancestry, offspring, vigour, etc..\n* Avoid more specific terms for types of blood, e.g. dried blood (e.g. as a food), etc.\n* If a language has no cover term, but has separate terms for lighter red (arterial) and darker red (vein) blood, then select whichever is the more basic, and only if that cannot be determined, select specifically the term for lighter red, arterial blood.\n"
17,bone,1394,BONE,"Any of the components of an endoskeleton, consisting mainly of calcium phosphate, collagen and cells.","##### Illustrative Context\n_He fell and broke a **bone**._\n\n##### Target Sense\n* Most generic term, and which must be applicable to bones of the human body.\n* In many languages, the generic term will be widely applicable to the bones of animals, too.  Avoid, however, terms specific to certain animals or fish, e.g. French _arête_ (fishbone).\n* Avoid terms specific to ‘bone’ as a substance, e.g. of which things can be made.  The term must be applicable to an actual bone, e.g. in a skeleton.\n* Avoid any more limited terms that are specific only to certain types of bone (e.g. _antlers_), or to certain uses (e.g. for food), and so on. \n\n\n"
18,chest,1592,CHEST,The portion of the body from the base of the neck to the top of the abdomen; the thorax.,"##### Illustrative Context\n_His wore a medal on his **chest**._\n\n##### Target Sense\n* The part of the human body between the shoulders and the diaphragm/upper belly (as seen from the front side, but also referring to within the rib-cage, not just in front of it — see below).  \n* Effectively this corresponds to the thorax in medical terminology, but following IE-CoR policy, certainly do not select such technical medical terms. Follow the basic, default register instead, i.e. English _chest_, definitely not _thorax_.\n* Provide the general term for this part of the body, that can be applied to both males and females, both children and adults. Certainly do not select a lexeme that refers only, or predominantly, to the female breasts.  The English lexeme for this target sense is therefore _chest_ (not _breast_ — see also below), in French _poitrine_ (not _sein_), and in Spanish _pecho_ (not _seno_).  Only if a language has no common term, select the word for _male_ chest.  \n* Also avoid figurative uses, senses such as English _bosom_, and euphemistic ones.\n* The term selected should be general _also_ in being able to refer to the part of the body _within_ the rib cage, not just in front of it.  Again, _breast_ is thus not the right lexeme in English, since it refers primarily to the part of the body _in front_ of the rib cage, whereas the correct _chest_ can indeed refer to inside the rib cage too, as in _a chest infection_. Likewise in French, the correct word _poitrine_ is used in, for example, _angine de poitrine_. \n* The need for a general term also means that lexemes that apply only to inside the ribs, such as _rib cage_ or _lungs_, are also to be avoided. \n* Do not be confused by the potential ambiguities in English, which has both a common _chest_ word, as well as another term _breast_. They are only part-synonmous, in that _breast_ can be applied to males or females, but is also ambiguous, because in context it can also have the specific sense of the female breast, and indeed can be used in the plural. Modern usage is tending towards _chest_ as the more general term. In this general sense, _breast_ is becoming dated for many speakers.  It remains in some fixed collocations (e.g. _breast stroke_ in swimming), but otherwise is increasingly reserved as specific to females. (It would sound odd to say _he was punched in the breast_, for example. And while both sexes can suffer _chest pain_, the expression _breast pain_ would normally be taken as referring to a woman only.)\n\n\n"
19,breathe,1407,BREATHE,"To repeatedly draw air into, and expel it from, the lungs, in order to extract oxygen from it and excrete waste products.","#### Illustrative Context\n_People can't **breathe** underwater._\n\n#### Target Sense\n* Most generic term, typically verbal, covering both breathing in and out together, as a cycle.\n* Avoid terms that mean specifically breathing _in_ or _out_ — unless one of those terms doubles up as also the generic, unmarked term for the whole cycle of breathing. \n* Only if a language (unusually) has no single term that covers both breathing in and out, then select whichever of those two terms is the most basic and general.  Only if that cannot be distinguished, then select the term for breathing _in_.\n\n"
20,burn,2102,BURN,To put fire on something or to be on fire.,"#### Illustrative Context\n_The wood is **burning** in the fire._\n\n#### Target Sense\n* The most generic, neutral **intransitive** verb for the process of combustion of material, the process that changes an object like wood from its natural state into ashes.  \n* In many languages this will correspond to a middle voice or reflexive:  e.g. Spanish _quemarse_.  \n\n* [Avoid intensifying terms](https://github.com/lingdb/CoBL-public/wiki/01--Policy-on-Selecting-Lexemes#unmarked--neither-intensive-nor-attenuating) for burning especially strongly or brightly:  e.g. _blaze_, Spanish _arder_.  \n\n* [Avoid figurative terms](https://github.com/lingdb/CoBL-public/wiki/01--Policy-on-Selecting-Lexemes#unmarked--literal-not-figurative-or-emotive) for 'burning' with emotion, desire, anger etc.:  e.g. Spanish _arder_.  \n\n* Avoid non-neutral terms for burning seen as dangerous and undesirable:  e.g. _be on fire_.  \n\n* Avoid terms that explicitly stress completeness and/or destruction:  e.g. _burn up_, _burn down_.  \n\n* Avoid inchoatives or causatives:  e.g. _catch fire_, _set on fire_, _light_.  \n\n* [Avoid technical and scientific terms](https://github.com/lingdb/CoBL-public/wiki/01--Policy-on-Selecting-Lexemes#unmarked-default-register-of-everyday-speech):  e.g. _combust_.  \n\n\n"
22,cloud,1489,CLOUD,Suspensions of minute water droplets or ice crystals produced by the condensation of water vapour.,"##### Illustrative Context\n_There were white **clouds** in the blue sky._ \n\n##### Target Sense\n* The most generic term for a (white) cloud, in the sky.\n* Avoid terms for ‘cloud’ at ground level, if different, e.g. _fog_, _mist_.\n* Avoid terms specific to particular types of cloud:  _raincloud, _dark cloud_, _thunder cloud_.\n* Avoid technical, meteorological terms.\n"
23,cold,1287,COLD,Having a low temperature.,"##### Illustrative Context\n_The rocks get hot during the day and **cold** at night._  \n\n##### Target Sense\n* The default antonym of [hot](../wiki/Meaning:-hot). \n* The most basic term, typically adjectival, that covers the **largest span** of temperatures lower than neutral, and the **middle ground** of that span of temperatures (within sensible bounds of the usual temperature range in human experience).  \n* This should be a generic, relative term, not a specific and absolute one such as _ice cold_, _freezing cold_.\n* Avoid marked, loaded, judgement terms for excessively cold, or not cold enough.\n* Aim for the term covering the broadest range of tactile, ambient and personal uses.\n* Avoid narrow terms limited to specific uses, e.g. cold only of food, only of liquids, only of weather, and so on.\n* Avoid resultative or change of state terms for _made cold_, _cooled_, _chilled_.\n* Select the default, unmarked term, i.e. avoid both intensifying terms for particularly cold, ‘freezing’;  and qualifying, weakening terms such as (only) _cool_. \n\n##### References\n* On the contrasts of ambient vs. tactile in languages of Vanuatu (François 2015), and in Japanese.  \n* On the contrasts of tactile vs. ambient vs. personal (Koptjeskaja-Tamm 2011).\n* On the contrasts between terms for things which _are_ cold, and which _have become_ cold, i.e. ‘cooled down’ (Bowern and Kling 2015). "
24,come,1446,COME,"To move toward or to reach either the speaker, the person spoken to, or the subject of the speaker's narrative.","##### Illustrative Context\n_I saw him on the road. I don’t know where he was **coming** from._\n\n##### Target Sense\n* The most generic intransitive verb for moving towards a deictic point of reference.  The term selected must be able to refer to humans walking, but should not be specific to only that case.\n* Avoid terms limited to particular ways of moving, e.g. on foot, riding an animal, or by transport.  Some languages do have several distinct verbs for ‘come’ for particular ways of moving.  Only if none of these can serve as an unmarked cover term for ‘come’, applicable to any way of moving, select the lexeme for humans walking.\n* Avoid terms for moving in general but which do not specify the deictic directionality of ‘come’.\n* Avoid terms specifically with inchoative meaning, e.g. _set off for_.\n* Avoid terms specific to coming _from_ a place, including usage referring to a home territory where one is originally from.\n* See also the definition for the IE-CoR meaning [go](../wiki/Meaning:-go).\n"
25,count,1420,COUNT,To enumerate the digits of one's numeral system.,"##### Illustrative Context\n_I **counted** the stones; there were five stones._\n\n##### Target Sense\n* The most generic transitive verb for counting (up) objects.  \n* This term should be applicable (as in the illustrative context) to the act of **counting up** objects one by one, starting from one and stepping up to the total.\n* Avoid terms for more complex calculating, reckoning, or working out by some form of mathematical procedure, beyond simply counting up one by one.  E.g. in German the target lexeme is _zählen_, not _rechnen_.  \n* Select the basic term for counting actual things in concrete cases — i.e. avoid terms specifically for reciting a numeral sequence in the abstract.\n* Avoid technical and mathematical terms like _enumerate_.\n\n\n"
27,day,1225,DAY (NOT NIGHT),The period between sunrise and sunset where one enjoys daylight.,"##### Illustrative Context\n_**Day** and night._\n\n##### Target Sense\n* The most generic term for day as the basic antonym of [night](../wiki/Meaning:-night).\n* In many languages, like English, the same basic term can also refer to the whole 24-hour period, the cycle of both day and night.  Avoid, however, terms that refer exclusively to the 24-hour period, and are not also the basic term for _day_ as opposed to night.  \n* The term for the period of time alternating with night, not just for _(day)light_ or _bright(ness)_ in general.\n"
28,die,1494,DIE,To cease to live.,"##### Illustrative Context\n_Everyone **dies** sooner or later._\n\n##### Target Sense\n* The most generic verb for the death of people, non-specific as to cause.  \n* The lexeme selected must be applicable to humans, although in many languages will also serve for animals and plants. \n* Avoid terms specifically for dying ‘of old age’, or specific to any other cause. \n* The most neutral register, literal term.  Avoid lexemes that are emotionally charged (e.g. _perish_), euphemistic or polite (e.g. _pass (away)_), literary (e.g. _expire_) or slang (e.g. _kick the bucket_).  \n* The basic term in a language may of course have originated in some such register, but since lost those connotations and become simply the normal default term for ‘die’.  If so, then it is indeed now the lexeme in the IE-CoR target sense, and should be selected. \n* Avoid terms with specific connotations of violent death.\n* See also the target specifications for the separate IE-CoR meanings [kill](../wiki/Meaning:-kill) and [live](../wiki/Meaning:-live).\n"
29,dig,1418,DIG,"To move earth, rocks, etc. out of the way, usually to create a hole.","##### Illustrative Context\n_He is **digging** in the ground._\n\n##### Target Sense\n* The most generic verb for digging (by people), typically to create a hole, by removing earth, soil, sand, etc..\n* Prototypically an intransitive verb for the general activity of digging.  In a language where the basic verb is only transitive, then the object should be the _hole_ dug, not an object uncovered by digging.\n* Avoid terms specific to the (transitive) sense of uncovering _something_ buried underground (whether coming across it by chance or intentionally searching for it), i.e. digging _for_ something, or digging something _up_ or _out_.\n* Also avoid terms specific to digging a hole in order to bury something, including verbs specific to digging a grave for a body.  Indeed, obviously avoid verbs for _bury_, that include the sense of filling back in and covering up whatever is placed in the hole dug.\n* Avoid terms specific to digging with a certain instrument, e.g. _shovelling_.\n* Avoid technical or high-register terms, e.g. _excavate_.\n"
30,dirty,1230,DIRTY,Covered with or containing unpleasant substances such as dirt or grime.,"##### Illustrative Context\n_This cup is clean and that one is **dirty**._\n\n##### Target Sense\n* The most generic term, typically adjectival, as the antonym of _clean_.  \n* The target is the literal sense of ‘dirty’, of an object.  Avoid terms that are primarily figurative, e.g. for morally _impure_, _unfair_, _treacherous_.\n* The target sense is visual, prototypically referring to a surface to which other materials have become applied.  Avoid terms that have specific connotations of unpleasantness or smell. \n* The most neutral-register term.  Avoid euphemistic terms (e.g. _soiled_) or slang (e.g. _mucky_).\n* Avoid intensifying or (negative) judgement terms, such as _filthy_, _foul_.\n* Avoid overly specific terms that identify particular types of substance that cause the dirtiness:  e.g. _dusty_, _muddy_, _soiled_, _greasy_, _rusty_, etc..\n* Avoid terms specific to a particular form of dirtiness:  e.g. _stained_, _soiled_, _discoloured_.\n* Avoid vaguer terms for simply _black_, _dark_, etc..\n\n"
31,dog,2009,DOG,"A common four-legged animal, especially kept by people as a pet or to hunt or guard things.","##### Illustrative Context\n_I’d like to own a **dog**._\n\n##### Target Sense\n* The most generic term for a domesticated dog (_canis familiaris_).  Must **not** be the name of any particular breed(s) of dog.  \n* Avoid terms limited to particular types of dog, bred for particular purposes, e.g. English _hound_ as a hunting or racing dog.\n* Avoid words specific to dogs of particular ages or sexes, e.g. _puppy_, _bitch_, etc.. \n* The default register term:  avoid slang terms (e.g. _mut_) and technical, biological terms (_canine_).\n* The most neutral term:  avoid loaded, judgement terms that bear specific connotations, such as affection (e.g. _doggie_, _pooch_), pejoration (_mut_) or danger (_mastiff_, _cur_)."
32,drink,1401,DRINK,To consume a liquid through the mouth.,"##### Illustrative Context\n_He **drank** because he was thirsty._\n\n##### Disambiguation\nThe **verb** _(to) drink_, not the noun _(a) drink_.  The generic term, without any specific reference to alcohol.  \n\n##### Target Sense\n* The most generic verb for drinking, prototypically of people drinking water.  The lexeme selected must be able to be used in that context, although will normally have much wider applicability too to animals drinking, and to all liquids that can be drunk.\n* Avoid terms specific to particular ways of drinking, e.g. _sip_, _sup_, _suck_, _lap_.\n* Avoid intensifying terms for drinking fast or in large amounts, e.g. _guzzle_, _down_.\n* Avoid terms specific to social or cultural contexts, e.g. ritual drinking.\n* Avoid terms specific to drinking _alcoholic_ drinks, or with the intention or result being getting drunk.\n"
33,dry,1398,DRY,(Almost) free from liquid or moisture.,"##### Illustrative Context\n_Is it **dry** or wet?_\n\n##### Target Sense\n* The most generic adjective as an antonym of [wet](../wiki/Meaning:-wet).\n* Avoid terms specific to only an outer surface:  the lexeme selected should be a generic one that can also refer to lack of water or moisture throughout a material.\n* A neutral term, without judgement or connotations of dryness as positive or negative (e.g. _arid_) in any given case.\n* Avoid intensifying terms for extremely or excessively dry, e.g. _parched_.\n* Avoid terms specific to dry earth or land, e.g. _arid_. \n* Avoid any other more specialised terms, e.g. _desiccated_.\n* Avoid terms that specifically indicate a change of state, e.g. _dried (up)_, _dried out_, _desiccated_.\n* Avoid terms specific to figurative uses, e.g. dry of humour, drinks, etc.."
35,dust,2,DUST,Any kind of solid material divided in particles of very small size.,"##### Illustrative Context\n_When the ground is dry, you kick up **dust** when you walk._\n\n##### Target Sense\n* The most generic noun for dust.  Must be able to refer to the dust kicked up from dry earth, as in the illustrative context.  \n* In most languages the generic term will also be applicable more widely, including to the dust that gathers over time on surfaces within buildings.  Do not, however, select a term specific only to such dust within buildings.\n* Avoid terms that specifically mean _ash_.  Only if a language has a single basic term that covers both _ash_ and _dust_ (e.g. Hittite, Ancient Greek, Old Irish) should the same lexeme be selected both here for ‘dust’ and for the distinct IE-CoR meaning [ash](../wiki/Meaning:-ash)."
36,ear,1247,EAR,"The organ of hearing, consisting of the pinna, auditory canal, eardrum, malleus, incus, stapes and cochlea.","#### Illustrative Context\n_One of his **ears** is bigger than the other **ear**_. \n\n#### Target Sense\n* The basic, default term for the human ear.  \n* The generic term in most languages will also be applicable to the ears of animals, but do not select a term that can be applied only to animals.  The lexeme selected must be the basic word for the human ear.\n* The default sense is the physical one, referring to the part of the body, not the functional sense of the organ for the sense of hearing.\n* Avoid terms specifically for the inner ear.  The lexeme selected must be able to refer to the part of the ear visible outside the skull, whether or not its reference can extend to the inner ear.  \n* Avoid terms used primarily to refer not to the anatomical, visible ear, but to figurative senses of listening, attentiveness, or hearing.\n* Give the singular form, avoiding special dual/plural formations.\n* Neutral, default register:  avoid technical, medical terms, and slang or jocular terms, e.g. _lug_.\n\n"
37,earth,1228,EARTH (SOIL),The soft and loose material forming a great part of the Earth surface.,"##### Illustrative Context \n_As he dug the hole, he threw out the **earth**._\n\n##### Target Sense\n\n* The most generic term for the loose material that covers a land surface — **not** the planet, the _world_.\n* In many languages this _may_ be the same term as for the _planet_ ‘earth’ (as in English), in which case this generic term will be suitable.  But avoid terms that are specific to the sense of the planet.  So for example in French _monde_ is wrong, and _terre_ is correct for the target sense.\n* In many languages this will be the same term as used in the traditional Classical concept of the four ‘elements’, i.e. _earth_ as opposed to _air_, _fire_ and _water_.\n* Avoid terms specifically for _cultivated_ earth to plant in, e.g. _soil_.\n* Avoid narrower terms for specific types of earth, e.g. sandy, silty or clayey soils.\n* Avoid terms specifically for _land_, _country_, _countryside_, etc..\n\n\n**Note:**  This IE-CoR target sense is significantly different to the ‘earth’ meaning as intended in versions of the Swadesh basic vocabulary lists.\n\n_See the IE-CoR language entries for this meaning on the [website](https://iecor.clld.org/parameters/37) or [data entry system](https://cobl.info/meaning/earth)._\n\n"
38,eat,1336,EAT,To consume something solid or semi-solid (usually food) by putting it into the mouth and eventually swallowing it.,"##### Illustrative Context\n_**Eat** some food and drink some water._\n\n##### Target Sense\n* The most generic verb for eating, prototypically of people eating a basic, traditional foodstuff.  The lexeme selected must be able to be used in that context, although will normally have much wider applicability too, to animals eating, and to most or all other foods.\n* The default register term:  avoid polite or euphemistic words (e.g. English _dine_, German _speisen_, Russian _кушать_), slang (e.g. French _bouffer_), nursery words (e.g. _munch_), etc..\n* The general sense of taking food into the body, without focusing on any particular way of eating or muscular action in the mouth, i.e. avoid specific terms like _chew_, _nibble_, _swallow_, etc..  (Note that language change can alter the specificity of such words.  The Latin word _manducare_ originally meant ‘chew’, and thus is not the IE-CoR lexeme for ‘eat’ in Classical Latin. Nonetheless, that word root has since given rise to Italian _mangiare_ and French _manger_.  These no longer bear any of the original connotation of specifically ‘chew’, and have become the default, unmarked lexemes for the IE-CoR meaning ‘eat’ in these languages.)\n* Avoid intensifying verbs, e.g. _eat up_, _devour_.\n* If a language has different default words used with different types of food (e.g. meat, cereals, fruits/nuts, hard food, soft food, liquid food, etc.), then select the most generic word.  If no term can be identified as more generic than others, select the verb used for eating the most basic, traditional foodstuff for most speakers of that language:  e.g. rice, bread, maize, etc., as appropriate.  This should therefore also be the most statistically frequent ‘eat’ verb in that language. \n* The literal sense of eating, i.e. avoid figurative senses of things being _eaten away (at)_, gradually losing mass or emotionally undermined by. \n\n"
39,egg,744,EGG,"Egg (either fertilized or not) from domesticated birds, most commonly hens, seen as food.","##### Illustrative Context\n_Don't drop the **egg**; it’ll break!_\n\n##### Target Sense\n* The most generic noun for the egg of a bird.\n* Must be able to refer to the prototypical sense of an egg with a hard outer shell, generally light in colour, and of medium size, such as the egg laid by a duck or a hen.  \n* In many languages the lexeme selected may be more widely applicable, including to reptiles, but do not select terms specific to the eggs of reptiles. \n* Similarly, the term selected may be applicable also to soft ‘eggs’ without a hard outer shell, but do not select terms specific to this sense.  \n* Follow common usage, not strict biological terminology.  Certainly avoid technical terms such as _ovum_, and terms limited to specific types of biological egg, e.g. _frogspawn_.\n* Avoid terms limited to eggs seen as food.\n\n "
40,eye,1248,EYE,"The organ that is sensitive to light, which it converts to electrical signals passed to the brain, by which means animals see.","##### Illustrative Context\n_She closed one **eye**._\n\n##### Target Sense\n* The basic term for the human eye.\n* Follow normal usage in the language, rather than technical anatomical definitions of what constitutes the ‘eye’.  \n* The lexeme selected must be able to refer to at least the part of the eye visible in the face, whether or not its usual reference can extend to the whole eyeball, the eyelids, tear duct, and so on.\n* Avoid terms specifically for the whole _eyeball_, or particular parts of the eye (e.g. _iris_).    \n* The generic term in most languages will also be applicable to the eyes of animals, but do not select a term that can be applied only to animals.  The lexeme selected must be the basic word for the human eye.\n* The default sense is the physical one, referring to the part of the body, not the functional sense of the organ for the sense of sight.\n* Avoid terms used primarily to refer not to the anatomical eye, but to figurative senses of vision, watching or attentiveness.\n* Give the singular form, avoiding special dual/plural formations (e.g. the lexeme to give for French is _oeil_, not _yeux_). \n* Neutral, default register:  avoid technical, medical terms, and slang or jocular terms."
41,fall,1280,FALL,To descend in free fall due to the effect of gravity.,"##### Illustrative Context\n_I **fell** from the tree yesterday and hurt my back._\n\n##### Target Sense\n* The most generic intransitive verb for falling from a height, through the air, to the ground.\n* In many languages this may be the same verb as used for just falling _over_ from standing, walking or running.  Avoid, however, any verb that is limited to these senses.  The verb selected must be applicable to falling from a height, as in the illustrative context.\n* In many languages the basic verb may be applicable to objects falling as well as to people (as in the illustrative context).  Avoid, however, verbs applicable only to objects falling.  The verb selected must be applicable to people falling.\n* Avoid terms with more specific senses of falling _off_ a surface, _tripping up_, _tipping over_, etc..\n* Avoid terms that include reference or implications of the cause of falling.\n"
42,far,1406,FAR,Having a large intervening distance with regard to something.,"##### Illustrative Context\n_You can’t walk there in one day; it’s too **far**._\n\n##### Target Sense\n* The most generic word, typically adverbial, indicating considerable distance from a point of reference.  The basic antonym of [near](../wiki/Meaning:-near) — see also the IE-CoR definition for that meaning.\n* Avoid adjectives, if different, e.g. _distant_, _remote_. (Some languages with large adjectival classes may derive words for ‘far’ from an adjective.)\n* Avoid dedicated adpositions.\n* Avoid compound expressions, e.g. _far away_, unless one such compound really has become the most basic term for ‘far’.\n\n\n\n"
45,fear,1419,FEAR (BE AFRAID),To be scared of; to have an uncontrollable emotion of anxiety about something that causes a scared reaction or frightening impression.,"##### Illustrative Context\n_While the dog was here, I **was scared**._\n\n**Note:** the English lexeme _fear_ as a verb is for most speakers now a somewhat limited, formal or old usage. (The noun _fear_ remains very common.)  On these grounds, following the IE-CoR policy on register, the lexeme selected in English is (the more default register) _be afraid_ or _be scared_, depending on variety.\n\n\n##### Target Sense\n* The target sense is intransitive, i.e. for _being afraid_, not being afraid _of something_. \n* The target sense is stative, i.e. the condition of _being afraid_, so avoid change-of-state terms that mean _get frightened_, where different.\n* Depending on the language, the default intransitive form may be either marked or unmarked vis à vis the transitive form;  please nonetheless provide the intransitive.\n* There is no requirement or expectation for a simplex verb form like _fear_.  On the contrary, do not supply one if the basic expression in your language uses some other construction.  E.g. in French, the basic term is not _craindre_ but _avoir peur_.  Indeed in this particular meaning there is a great deal of variation in the precise constructions used across different languages, for example:\n    - Latin (rather unusually) does have an unmarked intransitive _temere_.\n    - Greek and Old Irish use a middle voice.\n    - Slavic uses a reflexive verb.\n    - Many West European languages have moved to light verb constructions such as _have_ + noun, e.g. German _Angst haben_, or French _avoir peur_.\n    - English has _be_ + adjective _afraid_ or _scared_.\n    - Irish has _be_ with non-canonical subject marking + noun.\n\n\n\n\n\n"
46,feather,1201,FEATHER,"A branching, hair-like structure that grows on the skin of birds and protects them against coldness and water and allows their wings to create lift.","##### Illustrative Context\n_What bird does this **feather** come from?_\n\n##### Target Sense\n* The most generic term for a single feather of a bird.\n* Avoid collective terms, e.g. _plumage_.\n* Avoid terms limited to particular types of feather, e.g. _down_.\n* Avoid terms specific to particular uses of feathers, such as for decoration, cushioning, or as pens (e.g. _quill_).\n"
48,fight,1423,FIGHT,To be involved in a physical confrontation.,"##### Illustrative Context\n_The two men are **fighting** outside._\n\n##### Target Sense\n* The most generic intransitive verb for fighting in the literal sense of physical confrontation with blows.  \n* In many languages, the equivalent of English intransitive _fight_ may be a reciprocal/reflexive or middle, e.g. French _se battre_.\n* The generic term may also extend to fighting with weapons, and at a distance.  Avoid words limited to those specific senses, however.  The lexeme selected must be applicable also to physical fighting without weapons.  \n* Avoid terms for organised warfare, e.g. _battle_, where different.\n* Default register:  avoid elevated, literary terms (e.g. _combat_) and slang (e.g. _scrap_).\n* Avoid more terms specific to particular types of fighting, e.g. _wrestle_.\n* Avoid terms that are predominantly figurative, i.e. ‘fighting’ in the sense of merely competing or striving against others or for a goal, e.g. _struggle_."
49,nail,1896,FINGERNAIL OR TOENAIL,Hard keratin part growing at the end of a human's finger or toe.,"#### Illustrative Context\n_He had very long **nails** on his fingers._\n\n#### Target Sense\n* The nail as a part of the human body, at the end of a finger.  \n* Beware the polysemy of English _nail_:  not to be confused with a metal nail for hammering!\n* If your language has a generic term for the nails of both fingers and toes, that should be chosen, e.g. English _nail_.\n* If your language has no generic term, then select then the word for the nail of a finger, not a toe.\n* Enter only the root that refers to the _nail_ part — avoid entering an additional compounded element that literally means ‘finger’.  The correct entry in English is thus _nail_, not _fingernail_.\n* The term entered should normally be applicable to the nail of a single finger, and will thus normally be a singular form.  Avoid collectives, unless that is the default base form in your language, and additional morphology is required to specify a singulative.\n* Unlike some previous Swadesh-type lists, IE-CoR distinguishes the ‘nail’ of a human finger from the ‘[claw](https://iecor.clld.org/parameters/claw)’ of an animal;  each is a separate IE-CoR reference meaning.  In your language, the lexeme may be the same for both of these IE-CoR meanings (arguably a co-lexification).  This is not necessarily a problem, and you should certainly not specifically seek out two different terms to distinguish the two.  If both IE-CoR meanings ‘nail’ and ‘[claw](https://iecor.clld.org/parameters/claw)’ fall within the usage of a single basic lexeme in your language, it is fine to enter that same lexeme as the entry for both IE-CoR meanings, in line with the standard IE-CoR protocol to enter the single most general, basic and default  lexeme in your language that also naturally includes in its scope the IE-CoR target sense.  See also the entry on the IE-CoR meaning [claw](https://iecor.clld.org/parameters/claw).\n\n"
50,fire,221,FIRE,"The state of combustion in which inflammable material burns, producing heat, flames and often smoke.","##### Illustrative Context \n_He was cold, so he moved closer to the **fire**._\n\n##### Target Sense\n* Most generic, basic and default noun for _fire_, preferably applicable both to the concept of fire in general, and to a concrete instance of (a) fire.\n* In many languages this will be the same term as used in the traditional Classical concept of the four ‘elements’, i.e. _fire_ as opposed to _earth_, _air_ and _water_.\n* The lexeme selected should fit the target context (as in the illustrative context sentence) of a relatively small fire, controlled and intentionally set, for heating or cooking.\n* The lexeme selected should normally refer to fire visible in the form of flame(s), but avoid terms that have the narrower and more specific meaning of _flame_ rather than fire in general.\n* Avoid terms with specific narrower and limiting senses or usage of any kind, e.g..:\n    - Terms that are more limited to the abstract concept of _combustion_.  Indeed, avoid technical register terms such as English _combustion_.\n    - Terms specific to particular _types_ of fire, such as fire burning down a building,  e.g. French _incendie_ (rather than the correct generic word _feu_).\n    - Terms with specific senses of intense, uncontrolled, damaging and dangerous fire, e.g. _blaze_.\n    - Terms with a specific sense of a naturally occurring fire, e.g. _wildfire_, _bush fire_.\n    - Terms specific to _indoor_ fires, fireplaces or hearths, e.g. French _foyer_ (even if ultimately derived from the same root as correct _feu_).\n\n**Note:** the illustrative case of modern Romance languages derive their modern default _fire_ words not from the original Classical Latin _ignis_, but from the Latin word _focus_, which _originally_ meant only ‘fireplace’.  Regardless of that derivation and original sense, though, the cognates of _focus_ have in modern Romance languages long since broadened semantically to displace the _ignis_ root entirely, and take over its semantic slot as the basic _fire_ word here.  So the correct target lexemes for these languages in IE-CoR are indeed _feu_, _fuoco_, _fuego_, etc..\n\n\n\n\n"
51,fish,227,FISH,A cold-blooded vertebrate animal that lives in water that moves with the help of fins and breathes using gills (Pisces).,"##### Illustrative Context\n_I can see a **fish** swimming in the water._\n\n##### Target Sense\n* The most generic noun for a live fish.  \n* Avoid terms specific to caught, cooked or prepared fish, e.g. in Spanish the lexeme in the IE-CoR sense is _pez_, not _pescado_ (literally ‘fished’).  \n* Select the most generic term:  avoid terms specific to either fresh or saltwater fish, for example.\n* Follow common usage in the language, not strict biological classifications of what are or are not ‘fish’.  Avoid technical terms.\n\n"
52,five,493,FIVE,The fifth natural number (5).,"##### Illustrative Context\n_Four plus one is **five**._\n\n##### Target Sense\n* The default numeral five, as used when referring to inanimate objects. \n* Avoid the noun form for a group of five, e.g. _quintet_, or for a ‘number five’ (e.g. a bus).\n* Avoid any different terms used specifically when referring to humans or other animates. \n* Avoid terms specific to counting up or down, if different, e.g. in Irish, or in Russian where the lexeme for IE CoR [one](../wiki/Meaning:-one) is _odin_, not _raz_ (used when counting up).\n\n* In some languages, the same word root for the numeral five can take different grammatical forms.  \n    * In languages that have gender, give the common or masculine form.\n    * In languages that have a contrasting emphatic form, avoid this and give the non-emphatic form.\n\n* See also the target sense definitions for all five lowest numerals covered in IE-CoR:  [one](../wiki/Meaning:-one), [two](../wiki/Meaning:-two), [three](../wiki/Meaning:-three), [four](../wiki/Meaning:-four), [five](../wiki/Meaning:-five)."
55,flower,239,FLOWER,"The reproductive structure of angiosperm plants, consisting of stamens and carpels surrounded by petals and sepals all borne on the receptacle.","##### Illustrative Context\n_What type of **flower** is this?_\n\n##### Target Sense\n* The most generic noun for a flower, prototypically a small plant with a single stem and single flower head.\n* In many languages the same term may be applicable more widely also to each of the individual flower heads of a larger plant or indeed tree.  Avoid, however, terms specific to those referents, e.g. _bloom_, _blossom_.  The term selected must be able to refer to the prototypical case of a single stem and single flower head.\n* Avoid terms specific to prepared or cultivated flowers, or to wild flowers.  Only if a language distinguishes separate terms for wild vs. cultivated flowers, and does not have a common cover term applicable to both, then select the term for wild flower.\n* Avoid terms specific to particular uses of flowers, e.g. for decoration.\n* Avoid terms that are predominantly figurative, in senses such as beauty, freshness, prime or vigour, e.g. the ‘flower’ of youth. \n* Follow common usage in the language, not strict botanical definitions of ‘flower’.  Avoid technical, botanical terms.\n\n"
56,fly_V,1441,FLY (MOVE THROUGH AIR),"To move autonomously through the air, without any part of the object or object's enclosure touching anything attached to the ground.","##### Illustrative Context\n_Birds can **fly** but people can’t._\n\n##### Disambiguation\n* The **verb** _(to) fly_, not the noun for the insect (a) _fly_, which is the separate IE-CoR meaning [fly_N](../wiki/fly_V). \n\n##### Target Sense\n* The general, default verb for birds moving through the sky.\n* Avoid other roots used in more specific senses:  e.g. _fly off_, _fly away_, _soar_, _flit_. \n* Ignore figurative, non-literal senses of English _fly_, when used to mean just _go fast_, _flee_, and so on. \n* In some languages, e.g. in Slavic, motion verbs like _fly_ may reproduce the (part aspectual, part directional) opposition between two separate roots for _go_ vs. _walk_.  For _fly_ this can correspond to an opposition between:\n    - a neutral iterable verb _fly_, e.g. _Where is that bird flying to?_\n    - a habitual verb _fly_ (often morphologically more marked), e.g. _Little chicks don’t yet know how to fly_.  \n\n* In such cases, if neither root is more basic or default than the other, then exceptionally, both may be entered as synonyms.  See also the definition for the IE-CoR meaning [go](../wiki/go).  \n  \n"
57,fog,249,FOG,"Water droplets or, rarely, ice crystals suspended in the air in sufficient concentration to reduce visibility appreciably.","##### Illustrative Context\n_I couldn't see the village because of the **fog**._\n\n##### Target Sense\n* The most generic term for the equivalent of _cloud_, but at ground-level, and dense enough that it cannot be seen through.  Contrast with the meaning definition for the separate IE-CoR meaning [cloud](../wiki/Meaning:-cloud).  \n* If, like English, a language distinguishes denser _fog_ (that cannot be seen through at all) from thinner _mist_ (that does nonetheless allow even large but distant shapes to be made out), then select the term for denser _fog_.\n* Natural fog, not necessarily caused by pollution:  avoid words specific to that sense, e.g. _smog_. \n* In many languages, like English, the same generic term may be applicable both to fog on land and to ‘fog’ banks out at sea, or rolling onshore from the sea.  Do not, however, select a lexeme that uniquely or predominantly refers to sea fog.\n* In some languages there may not be a basic word specifically for (ground) fog, especially in regions where fog is very rare, or in mountainous regions where the distinction between _cloud_ and _fog_ can seem less rigid.  In such cases, provide the basic term that speakers would nonetheless use to describe fog if encountered elsewhere.  If such a description would be a compound or paraphrase, then select the lexeme within it bearing the most specific meaning closest to _fog_, e.g. the lexeme for _cloud_ in an expression such as _ground cloud_.  In this case, the term selected may be the same as for the separate IE-CoR meaning [cloud](../wiki/Meaning:-cloud)."
58,foot,1301,FOOT,The part of a human’s body below the ankle that is used in order to stand and walk.,"##### Illustrative Context\n_She has injured her **foot** so she can’t walk._\n\n##### Target Sense\n* The most generic noun for the foot as a part of the human body.  \n* In many languages the basic term may also be applicable to the feet of animals, which is not an issue provided that remains the basic term the target sense of the human foot.  Do not, however, enter any terms specific to animals, e.g. _hoof, paw_.\n* The target sense is the physical one of the human foot.  Avoid terms that are specifically or predominantly figurative, i.e. the foot as the ‘lowest part’, ‘base’ or ‘foundation’, e.g. at the ‘foot’ of a mountain or of a wall.  \n* Some languages may use the same basic lexeme not just for the foot but also applied to the lower leg or even the whole leg (e.g. Russian _нога_), and have no basic term specific to the foot.  This should be indicated in the notes field, but is not necessarily an issue.  So long as this undifferentiated lexeme is the most basic, default word used to refer to the foot, then that is the lexeme to select for this IE-CoR target sense, even if its reference may also extend ambiguously to part or all of the leg.  That is, do not provide a narrower term only because it is more specific to just the foot, if that term is less basic than the undifferentiated ‘foot/leg’ lexeme.  See also the target senses for the IE-CoR meanings [leg](../wiki/Meaning:-leg) and [hand](../wiki/Meaning:-hand).\n* Avoid terms specific to the (size or length of a) ‘foot’ as a unit of measurement. \n"
59,four,1500,FOUR,"The cardinal number occurring after three and before five, represented in Roman numerals as IV, in Arabic numerals as 4.","##### Illustrative Context\n_**Four** plus one is five._\n\n##### Target Sense\n* The default numeral four, as used when referring to inanimate objects. \n* Avoid the noun form for a group of four, e.g. _foursome_, _quartet_, or for a ‘number four’ (e.g. a bus).\n* Avoid any different terms used specifically when referring to humans or other animates. \n* Avoid terms specific to counting up or down, if different, e.g. in Irish, or in Russian where the lexeme for IE CoR [one](../wiki/Meaning:-one) is _odin_, not _raz_ (used when counting up).\n\n* In some languages, the same word root for the numeral four can take different grammatical forms.  \n    * In languages that have gender, give the common or masculine form.\n    * In languages that have a contrasting emphatic form, avoid this and give the non-emphatic form.\n\n* See also the target sense definitions for all five lowest numerals covered in IE-CoR:  [one](../wiki/Meaning:-one), [two](../wiki/Meaning:-two), [three](../wiki/Meaning:-three), [four](../wiki/Meaning:-four), [five](../wiki/Meaning:-five)."
60,freeze,1431,FREEZE,"To reach a chemically solid state, by the process of cooling.","##### Illustrative Context\n_When water **freezes**, it becomes ice._\n\n##### Target Sense\n* The basic term, normally an intransitive verb, for water turning to ice.\n* The same term is in many languages also applicable to objects containing water becoming frozen hard, but the basic term selected must also be applicable to water itself.\n* Avoid terms limited to figurative senses of ‘freezing’ as simply an equivalent for being or feeling particularly cold.\n\n "
61,fruit,1507,FRUIT,A botanical fruit that can be eaten raw used as food,"##### Illustrative Context\n_He picked **fruit** from the trees._\n\n##### Target Sense\n* The most generic term for fruit that can be eaten as food, typically fruit of a tree. \n* The most basic term may be collective rather than singular (perhaps with additional morphology to mark a singulative form). Provide whichever is the base form in the language.  \n* The literal term for edible fruit.  Avoid terms specific to figurative or metaphorical senses, e.g. _the fruit(s) of one’s labour_. \n* Avoid terms specific to any particular sort of fruit, such as terms specialised for smaller fruit, e.g. _berry_.\n"
62,full,1429,FULL,Containing the most or maximum amount possible in the given available space.,"##### Illustrative Context\n_An empty pot is easier to carry than a **full** pot._\n\n##### Target Sense\n* The most generic adjective for containing the maximum amount of something in a given space.\n* Avoid terms with specific overt reference to maximum capacity, e.g. _full up_, _overflowing_.\n* Avoid derived, resultative terms meaning _filled_, unless such a derived form has replaced the original ‘full’ root to become the default term, without retaining a specific resultative sense.\n* Avoid terms specific to particular objects or liquids that a vessel is full of. \n"
63,give,1447,GIVE,To transfer the possession or holding (of an object) to another person.,"##### Illustrative Context\n_He **gave** her a knife._\n\n##### Target Sense\n* The most generic transitive verb for somebody giving an object to somebody else.\n* The lexeme must be applicable to the prototypical case of an object being passed directly from giver to recipient, and from hand to hand, rather than indirectly.  (Many languages may also use their default term in wider ranges of contexts.)\n* The target sense is simply the transfer of an object from one person to another, without any other, more specific senses or implications of any sort, such as the motivation, purpose, or moral judgement of that act of giving something.  Avoid, for example, terms specific to giving seen as a charitable act, e.g. _donate_.\n* Avoid terms with specific implications of (transfer of) ownership or (temporary) use.  I.e., avoid terms specific to whether the giving is either temporary (e.g. _lend_) or permanent, for the recipient to keep.\n* Avoid terms specific to gift-giving, where different.  So in German, for example, the generic lexeme is not _schenken_ but generic _geben_.\n* Avoid terms specific to particular types of thing given, e.g. money.\n* Avoid terms specific to the particular manner in which a thing is given, or the conditions under which it is given:  e.g. _hand over, _give up_, _pass (on)_."
64,good,1035,GOOD,Having desired or positive qualities.,"##### Illustrative Context\n_That isn’t a bad idea, it’s a **good** idea._\n\n##### Target Sense\n* The most generic, default, unmarked adjective for positive judgement, as an antonym of [bad](/wiki/Meaning:-bad).  \n* The target sense is a general judgement of positive, i.e. beneficial or appropriate in the current context.  \nBeware the wide polysemy of the English lexeme _good_.  \n* Avoid terms specific to the sense of _morally_ right or _pure_.  There is no necessary implication of this in the IE-CoR target sense of ‘good’.\n* Avoid terms specific to any other sub-senses or contexts, such as specific terms for good weather, good-tasting, good-looking, _beautiful_, _‘cool’_, etc.. \n* Avoid marked, intensifying words, such as _excellent_, _wonderful_, _great_.\n* Some languages may not have a straightforward candidate lexeme for this target sense.  In such cases, as well as the illustrative context given above, consider also which term for ‘good’ works well in a wider variety of usage contexts. "
65,grass,606,GRASS,"A very large and widespread family of Monocotyledoneae, with more than 10.000 species, most of which are herbaceous, but a few are woody.

The flowers are inconspicuous, with a much reduced perianth, and are wind-pollinated or cleistogamous.","#### Illustrative Context\n_There is **grass** growing beside the river._\n\n#### Target Sense\n* The most generic term for grass as a general type of plant.  \n* In many languages, this generic term will also be the term used to refer to grass in the more specific context of the primary food source for grazing animals (wild and/or domesticated) such as horses, cattle and sheep.  Do not, however, select a lexeme that is _specific_ to this sense of grass as animal food.  Avoid, therefore, terms restricted to this narrower sense, i.e. terms equivalent to English _fodder_, _pasture_ or indeed _grassland_, rather than just the basic word for the plant (type). \n \n\n"

Avoid, however, terms that are specific to any such senses and are not the basic colour term.\n* Avoid terms that are typically limited or specific to green as the colour of living plants _only_, e.g. English _verdant_.\n* Avoid terms that refer specifically to particular types of plant or vegetation, e.g. _greenery_, _grass_, _foliage_ (especially if nouns!). \n* Avoid intensifying terms that imply exuberance and vitality of vegetation or landscapes, e.g. _verdant_, French _verdoyant_.\n* Avoid all and any near-synonymous terms, but which refer to a narrower colour range than the basic colour term for ‘green’, or to sub-shades of it:  e.g. _sea-green_, _olive_, _lime_, etc..\n* See also the target sense definitions for other colour terms in IE-CoR: [red](../wiki/Meaning:-red), [yellow](../wiki/Meaning:-yellow), [black](../wiki/Meaning:-black) and [white](../wiki/Meaning:-white).\n"
68,hair,2648,HAIR (HEAD),"The hair on humans, usually on the head but also including the hair on the body.","#### Illustrative Context\n_She pulled his **hair**._ \n\n#### Target Sense\n* The most basic term for the (body of) hair on the top of a human’s head.\n* This most basic, default term is in many languages a singular ‘collective’ or mass noun, e.g. English _hair_;  but in many others it is a plural, e.g. French _(les) cheveux_ (i.e. formally equivalent to English plural _hairs_). This is not an issue:  simply select the basic term, whether formally singular or plural.  (Cognacy in IE-CoR is based on the root, irrespective of inflectional markings for grammatical number.) \n* Select the term for the ‘mass’ or ‘body’ of hair on the head, *not for a single hair* (if different).  \n* The term that a language uses for a single strand of hair is not relevant, because that is not the target sense.  Various patterns are found.  In languages that use a plural form, the corresponding singular often refers to a single hair:  e.g. French _(les) cheveux_ is formally simply a plural of _(le) cheveu_, meaning a single (strand of) hair.  In languages such as English that use a singular mass noun like _hair_, this can be formally identical to the term for a single _hair_ (differentiated only by quantifiers as in _a hair_ vs. _some hair_).  Other languages may also have specific singulative forms to refer to a single hair.  These patterns should not influence the identification of the term entered, however, simply because a single hair is not the target sense.  Again, just enter whichever form (singular or plural) is the basic one in your language to refer to the mass or body of hair on the head.\n* Avoid terms that refer specifically or predominantly to hair not on the (top of the) head but on other parts of the body:  e.g. French _poil_, terms for facial hair (_beard_/_moustache_/_stubble_), body hair, hairs or _fur_ of an animal, etc.. \n* Avoid terms for specific kinds or colours of hair:  e.g. Spanish _canas_ for grey hair(s); _curls_ or _locks_ of hair;  blonde hair;  long hair, frizzy hair, etc..\n* Avoid terms that refer more narrowly to the character or a styling of hair rather than just the basic 'body part':  e.g. French _chevelure_, _coiffure_;  _head of hair_, _hairstyle_;  unkempt or shaggy hair, or non-neutral terms that imply any qualitative or aesthetic judgement.\n* Avoid technical, medical terms, if different.\n\n\n"
69,hand,1277,HAND,That part of the fore limb below the forearm or wrist in primates (including humans).,"##### Illustrative Context\n_He burnt his **hand**._\n\n##### Target Sense\n* The most generic term for the hand as part of the human body. \n* Avoid narrower terms that specifically mean the hand as a _fist_, or as outstretched, or the _palm_ of the hand. \n* Some languages may apply the same basic lexeme not just to the hand but also to the forearm or even the whole arm, and have no basic term specific to only the _hand_ (i.e. up to the wrist joint only).  This broad range should be indicated in the notes field, but is not necessarily an issue.  So long as this undifferentiated lexeme is the most basic, default word used to refer to the hand, then that is the lexeme to select for this IE-CoR target sense, even if its reference may also extend ambiguously to part or all of the arm.  Do not provide a narrower term only because it is more specific to just the hand, if that term is less basic than the undifferentiated ‘hand/arm’ lexeme.  See also the target senses for the IE-CoR meanings [foot](../wiki/Meaning:-foot) and [leg](../wiki/Meaning:-leg).\n* Avoid terms specific to the (size of a) ‘hand’ as a unit of measurement. \n* The target sense is the physical body part;  avoid terms specifically or predominantly figurative, emotional or judgmental, i.e. terms for hand in the sense of authorship, agency or skill (‘by my hand’), aiding (a ‘helping’ hand), accompaniment or support (‘hand in hand’), etc.. \n* Avoid technical, medical terms, if different.

74,heavy,1210,HEAVY,"Of a physical object, having great weight.","#### Illustrative Context\n_The rock was **heavy**._\n\n#### Target Sense\n* The most generic adjective expressing the considerable weight of a physical object.\n* The default opposite of 'light':  avoid intensive terms meaning _especially_ heavy.  \n* Use the basic term for the literal sense, referring to the weight of an object.  Avoid terms restricted to figurative senses, such as ‘difficult’, ‘serious’, ‘taxing’, ‘uncomfortable’.  \n* In some languages the adjectival form may be morphologically complex, often derived from a basic verbal root for weigh, be heavy’, e.g. Spanish _pesado_ and Italian _pesante_.  Provided that such a derivation has become the default adjectival form for 'heavy' in a given language, then that is the appropriate lexeme to select for that language.  Otherwise, avoid derivations such as English _weighty_, if not the default adjective.\n"
76,hit,1433,HIT,To give one blow or more with a swift movement.,"#### Illustrative Context\n_He **hit** the chair with the stick._\n\n#### Target Sense\n* Most generic and neutral transitive verb for a human agent hitting one object with another object.  \n\n* Beware the polysemy of English 'hit'.  The target sense is *not* that of success in hitting a target, i.e. the target sense is *not* the opposite of 'miss'.  So in German, for example, the form is 'schlagen' and not 'treffen'.\n\n* ""Most generic and neutral"" means that you should avoid close synonyms that are not neutral, and instead have more specific extra connotations, including any of the following:\n  - Avoid verbs that connote hitting with special force or resulting in breaking, e.g. 'whack', 'smash'.\n  - Avoid verbs with specific connotations of hitting for punishment, e.g. 'beat'.\n  - Avoid verbs specifically for repeated 'beating'; select a basic neutral verb that also works for a single hit.\n  - Avoid verbs specific to hitting directly with a particular part of the body, especially the fist, e.g. 'punch', 'thump'.\n  - Avoid verbs specific to hitting with given types of instrument:  e.g. 'club'.\n\nIn general this meaning is rather problematic, see:  https://github.com/lingdb/IELex2-CognaC/issues/19"

83,ice,617,ICE,The dense substance formed by the freezing of water to the solid state; it commonly occurs in the form of hexagonal crystals.,"#### Illustrative Context\n_**Ice** is frozen water._\n\n#### Target Sense\n* The most basic and generic noun for frozen (i.e. solid) water.  \n* This should be applicable to a tangible lump of ice or a layer on top of water.  In most languages, the default term will be the prototypical one applied to the frozen surface of a pond, for example. \n* Avoid more specific terms for ice in various particular forms and weather conditions:  i.e. do *not* enter terms specific to _hail_, _snow_, _frost_, _glacier_, _icicle_, and so on.  \n* Avoid terms specific to particular uses of ice, e.g. French _glaçon_ (_ice-cube_ or _block_) for cooling, _ice(-cream)_ for eating, etc..\n* Avoid figurative terms, for ice as symbolic of coldness, unfriendliness, white/blue colour, and so on."
86,kill,1417,KILL,To put to death; to end a life.,"##### Illustrative Context\n_They started fighting.  He **killed** him._\n\n##### Target Sense\n* Most generic and neutral transitive verb for killing in the literal sense of ending the life of a living being. \n* The lexeme selected must be applicable to killing humans (as in the illustrative context), but preferably not exclusively so.  In most languages (as in English) the most basic, default term is also applicable to killing animals or even also plants.  \n* Do not, however, select a term specific (or predominantly applied) to killing only humans, e.g. _murder_, unless the language has no basic ‘kill’ lexeme that is wider and more generic.  \n* Do not select a term specific (or predominantly applied) to killing only animals, e.g. _slaughter_, or plants.\n* Select the most neutral, basic term, i.e. avoid all terms that are narrower in that they bear additional and more specific meanings or overtones, including emotionally charged or judgmental ones, e.g.:\n    - Avoid intensive terms stressing the violence, brutality or number of people killed, e.g. _massacre_. \n    - Avoid euphemistic terms, e.g. _euthanise_. \n    - Avoid terms that are predominantly figurative, e.g. for ‘killing’ pain, a plan, hopes, etc..\n* Avoid terms that are specific to or predominantly used in a non-default register, e.g. literary _slay_, slang _do in_, or legal terms implying premeditation, intention or sentencing, e.g. _murder_, _execute_.\n* The basic term in a language may have originated in some such register, but since lost those connotations and become simply the normal default term for kill.  If so, then it is indeed now the lexeme in the IE-CoR target sense, and should be selected. \n* Avoid narrower terms specific to particular ways of killing, e.g. _slay_, _shoot (dead)_, German _erschießen_. \n* Avoid narrower terms that specifically denote or imply that the agent is non-animate, e.g. diseases ‘killing’ people. \n* Some languages use a causative construction of the type _make die_, and may thus share the same root as used in the separate IE-CoR meaning [die](../wiki/Meaning:-die).  This is not necessarily an issue, so long as this lexeme is the basic, most generic and neutral verb for kill in the language, and therefore should indeed be the entry for this meaning.  Certainly, do not provide an alternative lexeme simply out of a preference for a morphologically simplex stem, if that lexeme is less basic or generic than the causative construction.   \n* See also the target specification for the separate IE-CoR meaning [die](../wiki/Meaning:-die)."
87,knee,1371,KNEE,"In man, the joint in the middle part of the leg.","##### Illustrative Context\n_He put his hand on his **knee**._\n\n##### Target Sense\n* The most generic term for the knee as a part of the human body.\n* The term entered should be generic in referring to the articulation (as a whole) between the upper (thigh) and lower (shin/calf) parts of the leg, in the sense of the leg _bending at the knee_.  \n* Avoid narrower terms that refer to only more specific parts of the knee joint, e.g. English _kneecap_.\n* In most languages, and as in the illustrative context, the basic term for knee also has a prototypical application to the ‘front’ of the knee, upon which one might kneel, or rest one’s hand.  Do not enter terms such as the little-known English word _hough_, that refer instead to the ‘hollow’ _behind_ the knee. \n* In many languages the root used for this noun meaning also forms part of the corresponding verbal expression for _kneel_, as in English, in French _s’a**genou**iller_ or Spanish _ar**rodilla**rse_.  This is normal, but given that the target meaning here is the noun, provide only that form, not the verb form.\n* Give the form applicable to one knee, as in the illustrative context.  Usually this will of course be the singular form;  avoid any special dual/plural formations.  A dual/plural form should only be given if it is the basic, default form in a given language, which would require additional singulative morphology to refer to just one of the two knees.\n* Avoid technical, medical terms, where different.\n\n\n"
88,know,1410,KNOW (SOMETHING),To be certain or sure about something.,"#### Illustrative Context\n_“They’re coming tomorrow.” — “Yes, I **know**.”_\n\n#### Target Sense\n* The most generic verb for knowing **a fact**, having information about something. \n* Beware of the polysemy/broad applicability of the English lexeme _know_ .\n    - Do not confuse with ‘knowing’ in the sense of being acquainted with _people_ (or places).  If your language uses a different lexeme for this sense, e.g. Italian _conoscere_, German _kennen_, then do **not** provide this lexeme, but only the lexeme for the IE-CoR target sense of knowing a _fact_.  So the correct entry for Italian is only _sapere_ (not _conoscere_), for German it is _wissen_ (not _kennen_), for French _savoir_ (not _connaître_), and so on.\n    - Do not confuse with ‘knowing’ in the sense of being able to, having learnt or ‘knowing’ _how to_ do something, often related to the ‘can’ verb (e.g. German _können_) in contexts such as _I know how to swim_, _I know (how to speak) German_.  So again, the correct entry in German is _wissen_, not _können_.\n* The lexeme selected should be applicable to knowing an individual fact, as in the illustrative context.  Do not enter other lexemes with the specific and more abstract meaning of just being generally wise, intelligent, ‘knowing many things’.\n* The default term should be neutral.  Do not enter terms with specific judgement values of wisdom, ‘(all)-knowingness’, holy or sacred knowledge, etc..  \n\n\n"
89,lake,624,LAKE,"An enclosed body of water, usually but not necessarily fresh water, from which the sea is excluded.","##### Illustrative Context\n_Her house is beside the **lake**._\n\n##### Target Sense\n* The most generic noun for a naturally occurring body of still (and normally, fresh) water in the landscape, of the prototypical intermediate scale of English _lake_, in contrast to both a (smaller) _pond_ and to a larger _sea_.  \n* As a guideline, the lexeme selected **must** be applicable to a prototypical lake large enough that swimming right across it would be an intimidating challenge to most people, but not so large that it is not possible to see across to the land at the other sides of the lake.  \n* In many languages the default term may also be applicable more widely, but avoid other terms _specific_ to larger bodies of water, especially if seen as unbounded (e.g. _sea_, _ocean_, French _mer_), or that specifically denote relatively small scale (e.g. _pond_, French _mare_). \n* Compare with the similar approach to considerations of size in the separate IE-CoR meanings [river](../wiki/Meaning:-river), [forest](../wiki/Meaning:-forest), [bird](../wiki/Meaning:-bird) and [leaf](../wiki/Meaning:-leaf).)"
90,laugh,1355,LAUGH,"To express pleasure, mirth or derision by peculiar movement of the muscles of the face, particularly of the mouth, causing a lighting up of the face and eyes, and usually accompanied by the emission of explosive or chuckling sounds from the chest and throat.","#### Illustrative Context\n_When I saw him, he was **laughing**._\n\n#### Target Sense\n* The most basic and generic intransitive verb for laughing.  \n* Avoid terms for merely _smiling_, _grinning_ or _smirking_, that do not involve audible laughter.\n* Provide the most generic, non-specific term, and avoid narrower terms in any sense.  \n    - Avoid terms stressing some specific form of laughter, e.g. particularly loud, surprised, prolonged, hysterical, etc..\n    - Avoid terms that are specifically intensifying, e.g. _roar (with laughter)_.\n    - Avoid terms specific to disrespectful, suppressed or quiet laughter, e.g. _giggle_, _snigger_.\n"
91,leaf,628,LEAF,"The main organ of photosynthesis and transpiration in higher plants, usually consisting of a flat green blade attached to the stem directly or by a stalk.","#### Illustrative Context\n_He picked a **leaf** from the tree._\n\n#### Target Sense\n* The lexeme selected for the meaning ‘leaf’ in IE-CoR must be applicable (as in the illustrative context) to the prototypical sense of a leaf of a tree-like plant, predominantly thin and flat in shape, and of a prototypical size of the order of the leaf of a beech tree or oak.  \n* The default lexeme will of course in most languages be a broad term also widely applicable to leaves of many different shapes and sizes, including those of plants smaller than trees, but within that variety the term selected must also cover this prototypical case.  (Compare with the similar approach to considerations of prototypical form and size in the separate IE-CoR meanings [bird](../wiki/Meaning:-bird), [lake](../wiki/Meaning:-lake) and [forest](../wiki/Meaning:-forest).)\n* The prototypical colour – at least in the growing season – is green (given that the leaf is usually the main organ of photosynthesis), although the prototypical sense of leaf also includes that it is potentially deciduous, and thus may well change in colour before falling.\n* Do **not** focus on strict biological definitions.  IE-CoR policy is to favour basic, default terms, rather than technical, scientific ones.  So although technically, in biological classification, ‘leaves’ may encompass very distinctive physical forms, including the _pine needles_ of conifers, what matters to IE-CoR is popular usage, and how a language segments the semantic space, which typically does not strictly follow scientific criteria.  In the case of ‘leaf’, most languages focus on shape and size.  Select the most basic, default term, without strict attention to technical biological characteristics such as photosynthesis or deciduousness.  (Compare with the similar considerations in the definition of the IE-CoR meaning [ant](../wiki/Meaning:-ant).)\n* If the most basic lexeme in your language is a collective, then this can be entered provided that it is significantly more basic and default than alternative lexemes that could denote a single leaf.  In particular, if the term for a single leaf is a singulative, formed by adding additional morphology to the same basic root that is by default a collective, then that basic collective term can be entered, along with a note mentioning the singulative form.  (Since the root remains the same, this does not affect cognacy at the level of the root, as followed in IE-CoR.)  \n* Avoid, however, terms specific to the sense of _foliage_ where the language also has a basic term that can be applied to a single leaf as in the illustrative context.  The term in German is therefore _Blatt_, not _Laub_ (irrespective of the fact that _Laub_ is cognate with English _leaf_)., and in French _feuille_ not _feuillage_.\n* The term selected should refer to the literal leaf of a tree.  In many languages the same basic term may have other figurative senses too, but avoid other lexemes specific to non-literal senses of a leaf, e.g. a _sheet_ or _page_ of paper.  \n\n"
92,left,244,LEFT,Something that is on the left side relative to another object.,"#### Illustrative Context\n_He is blind in his **left** eye._\n\n#### Target Sense\n* The opposite of [right](../wiki/Meaning:-right) — see also the target meaning definition for that IE-CoR reference meaning.\n* Enter the adjective form, rather than the adverb.\n* Avoid forms specifically for the left hand, or that include a lexeme for _hand_, i.e. unless the original _hand_ element has become so semantically bleached that it is now just part of the basic default word for left, and could be applied as such also in cases such as the illustrative context, referring to the left eye.\n\n"
93,leg,1297,LEG,The limb of an animal (including humans) that extends from the groin to the ankle.,"##### Illustrative Context\n_He fell and broke his **leg**._\n\n##### Target Sense\n* The most generic noun for the leg as a part of the human body.  \n* In many languages the same basic term is also applicable to the legs of animals, or even more widely in a figurative sense, e.g. _a table leg_.  Avoid terms specific to any such senses, however, and which are not the default word for the human leg.\n* Where a language uses the same basic lexeme for _foot_ as well as _leg_ (e.g. Russian _нога_), with no basic term specific to _leg_ in contrast with _foot_, then that lexeme may be selected here, as well as for the separate IE-CoR meaning [foot](../wiki/Meaning:-foot).

So in German, the lexeme for this IE-CoR meaning is not _wohnen_ but _leben_. \n* Avoid terms denoting existence (including of objects) rather than life, e.g. _exist_.\n* Avoid terms that inherently bear more specific and additional senses beyond just being alive, including emotive or value judgement senses, e.g. ‘living’ well, happily or (‘living on’) in suffering.  \n* Avoid terms specific to starting or continuing to live, e.g. _be born_, _survive_, _live on_.\n\n\n"

Responsible for thousands of biochemical reactions.","##### Illustrative Context\n_When he died they found that his **liver** was very swollen._\n\n##### Target Sense\n* The basic term for the liver as a part of the human body.  \n* If your language uses a different lexeme for the _animal_ body part (and potentially also as a food), then do not enter this, enter only the basic term used to refer to the human liver.\n* The target sense is the literal one of the liver as a physical body part.  Avoid any other terms for liver that predominantly refer to figurative extensions, e.g. cultural perceptions of the liver as the source of various moods, emotions or characters:  bile, anger, wrath, courage (or cowardice), etc..\n\n"
97,long,1203,LONG,Having much distance from one terminating point on an object or an area to another terminating point.,"#### Illustrative Context\n_This is a **long** rope; that is a short rope._\n\n#### Target Sense\n* The lexeme selected should be the basic term that contrasts with 'short' in your language.  Indeed it should be the basic opposite to the term you enter for the IE-CoR comparison meaning [short](https://iecor.clld.org/parameters/short) -- see the precise definition for that comparison meaning, too.\n* The lexeme selected should be the most generic adjective for a relatively big distance between two points, prototypically the two ends of an object (on its longest dimension, usually perceived of horizontally rather than vertically).  \n* The target sense is **not** that of a long duration in time.  (That may also fall under the scope of the chosen lexeme, as it does in English, but do not choose a lexeme like 'lengthy' or 'prolonged' that refers most basically to time rather than size.) \n* The target sense is also **not** that of tall in stature.  I.e., do not give the opposite of ‘short’ in stature, but the opposite of ‘short’ in actual length.\n* Some languages may have different lexemes depending on the type or form of referent:  rope, clothing, hair, snake/worm, and so on.  In such cases, the prototypical referent to consider is a long and thin object like a piece of rope or string.  As per standard policy, however, please give not a specific lexeme exclusive to that sense, but the lexeme with most basic, broadest range that also includes that prototypical context.\n\n"

99,man,1554,MAN,An adult human member of the sex that begets young by fertilizing ova.,"#### Illustrative Context\n_I saw a **man** and a woman._\n\n#### Target Sense\n* The most generic term for an adult human male.  \n* In most languages this will be the term that is directly paired with the term for the IE-CoR meaning [woman](../wiki/Meaning:-woman), in basic phrases such as _man or woman_, _man and woman_.\n* Avoid hypernym terms for people, of either sex, e.g. the German lexeme for this meaning is _Mann_, not _Mensch_ (‘person’).\n* The lexeme selected must be applicable to a particular adult human male, as in the illustrative context.  In some languages the same basic word can also be used to refer generically to the human species, humans as distinct from animals, as in the (now declining) usage of English _man_ without an article.  This is not an issue provided that the term is the basic lexeme to refer to an adult human male, but do not provide a lexeme specific to this generic ‘species’ sense.\n* Avoid terms that inherently carry more specific senses of any type.\n    - Avoid terms specific to the place of a man in a relationship, marriage or kinship.  In many languages, the most basic and generic term is _also_ used as a translation equivalent to English _husband_, e.g. German _Mann_.  This is not an issue; but do not enter terms specific to the sense of _husband_, e.g. French _mari_ or _époux_.\n    - Avoid specific terms for younger or older men.\n    - Avoid weighted terms that inherently carry honorific or judgmental value:  e.g. _gentleman_, French _monsieur_.\n    - Avoid terms that specifically highlight perceived masculinity or virility.\n    - Avoid terms that are used to focus more narrowly as explicitly _male_, rather than more equally both male and adult, e.g. the Spanish lexeme here is _hombre_, not _varón_.\n* The neutral-register term:  avoid literary or poetic words (particularly in the sense of _hero_), and slang or colloquial terms, e.g. _bloke_, _guy_, _chap_, _fellow_.\n* See also the IE-CoR meaning [woman](../wiki/Meaning:-woman)."
101,meat,634,MEAT,"The edible flesh of animals, especially that of mammals.","##### Illustrative Context\n_What animal does this **meat** come from?_\n\n##### Target Sense\n* The most generic term for meat as the edible flesh of animals, prototypically: the ‘red’ meat of mid-sized land-mammals such as sheep, already cut from the animal’s body.  \n* The lexeme selected must normally be applicable to the meat of mammals (except in languages from cultures and regions where the default meat and the most basic term applies to a different type of animal).\n* In many languages, as in English, the same basic lexeme will cover a wide range of contexts and types of ‘meat’.  Where a language has no broad cover term, but only distinct, mutually exclusive lexemes for different contexts/types, in the following or any other cases, then always fall back on the most generic lexeme that includes within its scope the prototypical case as defined above.\n    - If a language has only distinct, mutually exclusive lexemes for the _flesh_ of a living animal vs. the _meat_ of one already killed, then select the latter.\n    - If a language has only distinct, mutually exclusive lexemes for the meat still on the animal’s body vs. already cut off it (in preparation for cooking or storage), then select the latter.\n    - If a language has only distinct, mutually exclusive lexemes for raw meat not yet cooked vs. already cooked meat, then select the former.\n    - If a language has only distinct, mutually exclusive lexemes for meat of different forms or colours , e.g. for the ‘red meat’ of most large mammals vs. the ‘white’ meat of poultry, then select the term for the ‘red meat’ type.\n    - If a language has only distinct, mutually exclusive lexemes for the meats of mid-sized land animals, of birds, of fish or acquatic animals, and/or of insects, then select the term for the meat of mid-sized land animals.\n    - If a language has only distinct, mutually exclusive lexemes for the meats of reared domesticates vs. hunted wild animals (‘game’), then select the term for whichever is the more basic among speakers of the language:  typically this will be reared meat among farming communities, hunted meat among foragers.\n* The target meaning is the literal one of meat as the physical flesh of animals.  Do not select lexemes that refer to food more broadly (the oldest sense of the lexeme _meat_ in English, as still in _mincemeat_).  Also, do not select lexemes that refer predominantly to figurative extensions, e.g. ‘meat’ in the sense of _sustenance_ or the core (‘meat’) of an issue.\n\n"
102,moon,1313,MOON,A natural satellite of a planet.,"#### Illustrative Context\n_I saw the **moon** and the sun in the sky._\n\n#### Target Sense\n* The term selected should be the basic, default word for the (earth’s) moon.  \n* In most languages this will be the term that is directly paired with the term for the IE-CoR meaning [sun](../wiki/Meaning:-sun), in basic phrases such as _sun and moon_, as in the illustrative context.\n* In many languages the basic term may also be applied to the satellites of other planets, but do not select technical or astronomical cover-terms that do not by default, when not further qualified, refer specifically to the earth’s moon, e.g. _satellite_.  E.g. in Russian the target lexeme is Луна (luna), not спутник (sputnik).\n* Enter the literal term for the celestial body.  Avoid loaded terms that inherently carry more specific senses of any sort, e.g. personifications of the moon, the moon seen in religious or mystical senses, the moon as a source of light at night, etc..\n* Avoid narrower terms for specific stages or appearances of the moon, e.g. _crescent_, Russian месяц (mesyats), _full moon_, _blood moon_.\n* Some languages use the same basic word also in the time meaning _month_.

Nonetheless, its range of application must normally include reference to the highest mountains in the world.  \n* Certainly, avoid terms such as English _hill_ that denote specifically something _not_ as high as the prototypical _mountain_.  Similarly, the French term is not _colline_, but _montagne_;  in German not _Hügel_, but _Berg_.\n* If a language has no one generic term, but mutually exclusive lexemes for different heights/scales/sizes of ‘mountain’, then select whichever basic term is applicable to mountains of the greatest scale.\n* The lexeme selected should be applicable to a single, standalone high mountain, prototypically with steep slopes.  \n* Avoid terms for highland regions in general, or for chains of mountains or highland plateaux, e.g. Spanish _sierra_, _cordillera_.  The lexeme selected will therefore usually be a singular form, not a collective or mass noun for _highland(s)_.  \n* Must be a generic term:  avoid terms specific to particular types of mountain, e.g. _volcano_, _fell(s)_, Spanish _nevado_ (i.e. specifically a snowcapped mountain), etc..  \n* Avoid terms for smaller-scale parts of mountains, e.g. peak, crag.\n* Avoid lexemes that are only or predominantly figurative, to refer to large quantities of or ‘heaps’ of things.  \n"

Where a language distinguishes the inner and outer mouth the term for the outer mouth .\n\n##### Target Sense\n* The most basic, default term for the mouth as a part of the human body.\n* The target sense is the prototypical one of the mouth seen as a whole, for which most languages have a generic term that can apply not just to the oral cavity, but can also take in the tongue, teeth and the lips as parts of this overall sense of mouth.  \n* Avoid terms specific to just individual parts of the mouth (e.g. _lips_) or for shapes of mouth.  \n* Follow common usage and basic vocabulary.  Strict anatomical or medical definitions are not relevant.  Avoid any technical, medical terminology.  \n* The term entered must be the default term for the human mouth.  As the most basic term, it may also be extendable to the ‘mouth’ or even ‘snout’ of other animals;  but do not enter any other terms applied only or predominantly to animals.\n* The target sense is the literal one for the physical body part, not any functional senses of speech, taste, eating, breathing, smiling, etc..\n* Avoid lexemes that are predominantly used only for figurative extensions, e.g. for the ‘mouth’ of a river (e.g. French _embouchure_), or for the sense of taste, the power of speech, etc..\n* Enter only the default, neutral register term.  Most languages have additional slang or jocular words (e.g. English _gob_, French _geule_), often derived from terms for the mouths of animals:  do **not** enter any such terms.\n\n"
106,name,1405,NAME,"Any word or phrase which designates a particular person, place, class or thing.","#### Illustrative Context\n_What **name** have you chosen for your baby?_\n\n#### Target Sense\n* The most generic noun for the name of a person.  Prototypically this should be the basic term that would be used in the illustrative context, where it can be expected that the family name is already known, and is not the focus of the question.  \n* Avoid narrower terms specific to a particular type of name (or even title), e.g. _surname_, _forename_, _nickname_, _sobriquet_.   \n* If (and only if) your language has no generic, umbrella term that can be applied variously to a family name, an individual identifying name, or a combined full name, then select the term that would be most normal in the illustrative context,assuming that the family name is already known.\n* In some languages, the most generic base noun (when not further qualified) may be ambiguous between the generic sense targeted here and one particular sub-sense, e.g. _Name_ in German can also be taken as specifically referring to the family name in a context where it is in explicit contrast with _Vorname_.  Irrespective of any such potential ambiguities and disambiguation techniques where necessary, however, enter the generic base noun as would be used in contexts where further specification is not needed.  So in German, the default, generic lexeme, as in the illustrative context above, is simple _Name_, not narrower _Vorname_.\n* Many languages use the noun less than English uses its noun _name_, and translation equivalents will often use instead a verb that more literally means _call (oneself)_, e.g. German _heißen_, French _s’appeler_.  Nonetheless, such languages do also tend to have a noun for _name_, e.g. in official contexts where identity is to be established.  Enter the noun form for this IE-CoR meaning, not a verb.\n\n"
107,narrow,1267,NARROW,Having a small width.,"#### Illustrative Context\n_The canyon is wide here, but further down it’s **narrow**._\n\n#### Target Sense\nThe target meaning is the opposite of [wide](https://iecor.clld.org/parameters/wide' (i.e. of gaps, spaces), **not** the opposite of _broad_ (i.e. of objects).  That is, the lexeme selected should be the normal adjective to refer to a small (horizontal) **gap** or **space** between two sides, rather than the small (horizontal) breadth of an object or person. \n\nIf your language has a cover term for both, then as a basic, general term that is indeed appropriate;  but if there are different terms, select the more default one for narrow gaps, not thin things.  \n\nThis is why in English the correct lexeme determination is _narrow_, not [thin](https://iecor.clld.org/parameters/thin).  \n\n* [Avoid intensifying terms](01--Policy-on-Selecting-Lexemes#unmarked--neither-intensive-nor-attenuating), or those that are not neutral but primarily entail a quality judgement as (excessively) _tight_, (too) close a fit, e.g. of clothing.\n\n\n"

(Some languages with large adjectival classes may derive words for ‘near’ from an adjective.)\n* Avoid dedicated adpositions, e.g. _near (to) the river_.\n* Avoid terms meaning specifically _beside_, _next to_, _adjacent_, etc..\n* Avoid compound expressions, e.g. _right by_, unless one such compound really has become the most basic term for ‘near’."

Avoid terms specific to other animals, however, and which are not the default word for the human neck.\n* If (but _only_ if) a language has no generic term, but only terms specific to either just the front or just the back of the neck, then select the latter. \n* Avoid narrower terms that refer to what are internal parts of the body that run through the neck.  That is, avoid terms for _throat_ and _spine_, for example.\n* The target sense is the literal, physical body part.  Avoid other lexemes that predominantly reflect extensions to other senses, particular that of a thin connecting part, e.g. a ‘neck’ of land, of a bottle (e.g. French _goulot_), the _collar_ of clothing, etc., or figurative senses such as the neck as a vulnerability.  The basic lexeme for this meaning in French, for example, is thus the body part term _cou_, not the more figurative _col_.\n* Avoid specifically medical terms, where different.\n\n"

Avoid terms that focus instead on state or condition, e.g. _fresh_ (of food).\n* Avoid intensifying terms that stress that something is especially recent, such as _brand new_, or terms that focus on contemporaneity, e.g. _current_.

114,old,1229,OLD,Having lived or existed for a relatively long period of time.,"##### Illustrative Context\n_He lives in the **old** house, not the new house._\n\n##### Target Sense\n* The default adjective as antonym of [new](../wiki/Meaning:-new), referring to an inanimate object.  \n* The target sense is thus **not the age of a person**, i.e. not the antonym of ‘young’.\n* In many languages, as with English _old_, the same basic lexeme can be applied both to inanimate objects and to the age of people or other animates.  This extension to a wider range of application is not an issue, so long as the lexeme concerned is the basic term for the target here:  old as applied to an inanimate object.  Avoid, however, lexemes that uniquely or predominantly apply to people (or other animates), e.g. _elderly_.\n* Avoid intensifying terms that specifically stress great age, e.g. _ancient_ or French _vétuste_.  Likewise, avoid attenuating terms for only somewhat old.\n* Avoid aspectual derivations such as _age**d**_, _age**ing**_ or French _vieill**issant**_, unless the literal aspectual sense has been lost and this lexeme has become a language’s default basic adjective for old.\n* The target sense is simply that of age.

That is:\n    - Do **not** enter a more abstract term for _precipitation_.  Only in the rare case of a language whose most basic lexeme does not distinguish between (liquid) rain and (frozen) snow, then this may be the target lexeme, since this makes it also the default term used for the target sense and illustrative context here.\n    - Avoid terms specific to frozen (or even partly frozen) forms of precipitation:  _snow_, _hail_, _sleet_.\n    - Avoid terms specific to barely perceptible _dew_ or _condensation_.  \n* The target sense here is of ‘rain’ as in turn a hypernym that covers a range of finer distinctions, for rain of different types, intensity or duration.  Avoid any such narrower terms, e.g. English _drizzle_, _downpour_, _shower_.  \n* See also, and contrast with, the definition of the separate IE-CoR meaning [snow](../wiki/Meaning:-snow).\n\n\n"

125,river,666,RIVER,"A stream of water which flows in a channel from high ground to low ground and ultimately to a lake or the sea, except in a desert area where it may dwindle away to nothing.","##### Illustrative Context\n_He lives beside the **river**._\n\n##### Target Sense\n\n* The most generic term for a river in the following prototypical sense:  a naturally occurring watercourse (i.e. not an artificial _canal_), prototypically of fresh water, flowing through the landscape (prototypically above ground, not underground), progressively from higher to lower elevations, and usually ending in a lake, the sea, or joining an even larger river.\n\n* The target **scale** should be the prototypical intermediate-to-large scale of English _river_.  Certainly, avoid terms equivalent to English _stream_ that denote something explicitly smaller in scale than the prototypical _river_. So likewise, the French term is not _ruisseau_, but _rivière_; in German not _Bach_, but _Fluss_.\n\n* As a guideline, the lexeme selected **must** be applicable to a prototypical river wide and deep enough that it cannot be trivially jumped over, but must be at least waded across, more usually swum across, or indeed may be so wide, deep or dangerous enough that swimming right across it would be an intimidating challenge to most people.  \n\n* In many languages the default term will be applicable across a wide range of scales and types of ‘river’ (according to local geographical conditions).  As noted, however, avoid any terms that specifically denote relatively small scale (e.g. _stream_).  \n\n* The basic _river_ term in most languages is applicable all the way up to the largest rivers in the world.  French, however, is relatively unusual in having a separate lexeme specific to rivers of especially large scale:  _fleuve_.  This is thus necessarily a narrower, less default term than _rivière_, which therefore remains the correct lexeme for IE-CoR ‘river’.  (_Fleuve_ is **not** to be selected for French.)\n\n* Avoid any terms that are narrower also in referring to any particular type of river in any other sense:  e.g. _torrent_, _tributary_, Spanish _arroyo_.\n\n* The default term should normally be applicable to an actual specific river, and should not be a more abstract or technical terms such as _watercourse_.\n\n* Avoid any narrower terms that focus on particular characteristics of a river, and/or figurative senses:  e.g. extensions to senses of flowing or time (_river of life_), swiftness, tears, etc..\n\n* (Compare with the similar approach to considerations of prototypical size in the separate IE-CoR meanings [lake](../wiki/Meaning:-lake), [forest](../wiki/Meaning:-forest), [bird](../wiki/Meaning:-bird) and [leaf](../wiki/Meaning:-leaf).)"

136,sea,1474,SEA,A body of salt water that is smaller than an ocean and generally in proximity to a continent.,"##### Illustrative Context\n_Her house is beside the **sea**._\n\n##### Target Sense\n* The most generic noun for _the_ sea, as a general environment, in contrast to land.  \n* The target sense is therefore the one particularly inherent in English usage _the_ sea, not in the count noun sense of _a_ particular, named _sea_ seen as a geographical unit in contrast to other ‘seas’.\n* To identify the basic, most generic lexeme in your language, follow only popular usage in this non-count sense.  In particular, do not focus on technical definitions or criteria, e.g. of what is claimed to ‘count’ as a _sea_ as opposed to a _lake_ or _ocean_ in geographical or cartographical analyses.  Ignore these count noun senses anyway.  Do **not** make judgements on the basis of the names of particular water bodies that may or may not be named as _lake_, _sea_ or _ocean_ (inconsistently) from one particular language to the next (e.g. the Baltic and Caspian ‘Seas’, but ‘Lakes’ Superior, Victoria or Baikal).  This terminology is inconsistent, and not relevant to the IE-CoR target sense.\n* The lexeme selected **must** be applicable to the prototypical case of sea that is of salt water, not landlocked, and in scale is unbounded from the perspective of an observer anywhere on land, i.e. sea that stretches at least to the horizon and whose other shore is so distant that it cannot be seen from any point on land.  Necessarily, this is far greater than the prototypical scale of English _lake_ and the corresponding IE-CoR meaning [lake](../wiki/Meaning:-lake).  \n* On the other hand, avoid terms that bear the specific geographical, cartographical sense of _ocean_, i.e. the largest scale of one of the limited number of specific named oceans on Earth, accepted in geographical terminology.   The term _ocean_ in English, like its equivalents in many other languages, represents a hypernym beyond the IE-CoR target sense of _sea_.  Do not enter terms for (or equivalent to) _ocean_. \n* Compare with the approaches to considerations of size also in the separate IE-CoR meanings [river](../wiki/Meaning:-river), [mountain](../wiki/Meaning:-mountain) and [forest](../wiki/Meaning:-forest).)\n* Enter only the default, neutral-register term.  Avoid all other, marked registers, such as literary, poetic or antiquated terms like _main_, _(the) deep_, French _(le) large_.  \n* The target sense is literal, the sea as the natural environment.  Avoid terms specific to extensions and figurative senses of the sea as vastness, wilderness, menace, oblivion, ‘highway’, etc. (e.g. _a sea of troubles, tears_, etc.). \n"

(That may also fall under the scope of the chosen lexeme, as it does in English, but do not choose a term like _brief_ that refers most basically to time rather than size.) \n* The target sense is also **not** that of short in stature.  I.e., do not give the opposite of ‘tall’, but the opposite of ‘long’.\n* Some languages may have different lexemes for ‘long’ depending on the type or form of referent:  rope, clothing, hair, snake/worm, and so on.  In such cases, the prototypical referent to consider is a long and thin object like a piece of rope or string.

In that case, select the most basic lexeme applied to the sky during the day.\n* Select the default, neutral term, avoiding lexemes specific to given registers, e.g. literary _firmament_.\n* Avoid technical and scientific terms , e.g. _atmosphere_, _ether_.\n* Avoid terms with specific overtones of weather, e.g. thundery sky, heavy sky. \n* Avoid terms with narrower additional connotations of a perceived specific shape of the ‘arc’ or ‘vault’ of the sky. \n* Avoid religious terms, e.g. _heaven(s)_, where different.\n"

147,small,1246,SMALL,Not large or big; small in size.,"#### Illustrative Context\n_This is a **small** stone. That is a big stone._\n\n##### Target Sense\n* The most generic term, typically adjectival, for small size in an unspecified dimension.  The basic, default antonym of [big](../wiki/Meaning:-big). \n* The basic term will generally be applicable very widely, but must be applicable at least to inanimate objects, as in the illustrative context.  \n* Avoid terms that only or predominantly refer to the size of people.\n* Avoid terms specific to a particular dimension like height, width or girth:  i.e. avoid terms such as _short_, _narrow_ or _thin_.  \n* Avoid intensifying terms stressing particular smallness, e.g. _tiny_, _minute_. \n* Many languages have a range of terms in this general semantic field, e.g. English _small_ (the target) but also _little_.  Select only the default, most neutral term.  To help identify this, use the standard tests in the general IE-CoR guidelines, such as:\n    - Which lexeme is most used in wh- questions:  e.g. English _How **small** is it?_, more neutral and normal than _How **little** is it?_\n    - Which lexeme has the fullest and most normal paradigm:  e.g. English _small**er**_, _small**est**_ are normal, whereas _little**r**_, _little**st**_ are considerably more marked.\n* In particular, enter the most neutral term, free from value judgements.  In particular, the target lexeme should not inherently bear affective and diminutive senses of endearing, as present in most uses of English _little_ rather than the more neutral default lexeme _small_.  \n* Enter a full (adjective) word form, not an affix.  Many languages use diminutive affixes just as widely, if not more so, than an adjectival root for _small_.  Nonetheless, these affixes also typically have additional affective senses, so are often not as widely used in the neutral, value-free target sense for IE-CoR.  Enter instead the full word form that is most neutral in this sense, as would be used in the illustrative sentence.  \n* See also the definition for the IE-CoR meaning [big](../wiki/Meaning:-big).  "

So not as in _the food smells good_.  \n* The **transitive** verb (form) used where the subject of the verb is the person who perceives the odour, while that odour, or the substance or thing emitting it, is the object.\n* Some languages (e.g. Slavic) have different verbs depending on whether the human subject is taken as either the experiencer or the agent (the same contrast that English itself has for other perception meanings such as _see_ vs. _look_ or _hear_ vs. _listen_).  In such languages, select the verb form where the human subject is **experiencer, not agent**, who perceives the odour passively, not actively and intentionally 'sniffing' for it.  So not as in _she knelt down and smelt the flowers_.   \n* Some languages do not have a specific verb uniquely for perceiving odours through the nose, as distinct to perceiving by other senses such as taste or touch, and so on, and use a more general ‘sense’ verb instead, e.g. French _sentir_ (for English _smell_ and _feel_).  In such languages, just select that more generic lexeme if it also covers the target sense here, as per the [general IE-CoR policy](https://github.com/lingdb/CoBL-public/wiki/01--Policy-on-Selecting-Lexemes#the-most-general-lexeme-in-our-target-sense).\n"

Strict technical and biological classification criteria are not necessarily relevant — see also the definition for the separate IE-CoR meaning [ant](../wiki/Meaning:-ant).\n* Enter the most neutral term for the type of animal, of this body form.  Avoid narrower lexemes that inherently bear particular connotations, even if common ones, such as danger, unpleasantness, or indeed religious interpretations.\n* Enter the generic term for the form of animal in general.  Do not enter narrower terms for a particular type or individual species of snake, even if this is the most common in a particular region or language.  \n* Some languages have two (or more) common lexemes that may distinguish different types of snake, e.g. venomous vs. non-venomous, constricting vs. venomous, or by size.  In such languages, enter the most basic lexeme, the one with the widest applicability, especially if it remains also the default, generic term for snakes when the type is unknown or not specified.  So in German the default term is _Schlange_, not _Natter_, and in French it is _serpent_, not (venomous) _vipere_ nor (non-venomous) _couleuvre_).\n* If a language has no generic cover term, but only multiple terms exclusive to different types or sizes of snake, then select the term considered most basic.  If that is not clear-cut, select the term most naturally applied to a prototypical case of a venomous snake of medium size, defined here as between 1 and 2 metres long, and between 2 and 5cm thick.\n* In some languages, a lexeme that was originally specific species word has since lost that specificity, and extended to become the default term for the form of animal in general.  In such cases, this semantic shift does qualify that lexeme as the IE-CoR target, e.g. some varieties of Spanish use _culebra_ as the default generic lexeme, replacing _serpiente_, which has become more narrowly elevated in register.  (Contrast this with the corresponding cognates in French, where _serpent_ remains the default generic lexeme, while _couleuvre_ still refers more specifically to a particular type of non-venomous snake.)\n* Enter the default register term.  Avoid terms that are literary, poetic or otherwise formal or slang.  The target lexeme in English is thus _snake_, not _serpent_.\n* The target term is the literal one for the type of animal.  Avoid terms that are predominantly figurative, e.g. imagery for unpleasant animals or indeed people, e.g. _viper_.\n* See also, and contrast with, the definition of the separate IE-CoR meaning [worm](../wiki/Meaning:-worm).\n"

That is:\n    - Do **not** enter a more abstract term for _precipitation_.  Only in the rare case of a language whose most basic lexeme does not distinguish between (frozen) snow and (liquid) rain, then this may be the target lexeme, since this makes it also the default term used for the target sense and illustrative context here.\n    - Avoid terms specific to liquid (or even just partly frozen) forms of precipitation:  _rain_, _sleet_.\n    - Avoid terms specific to hail, as precipitation in frozen form but in the form of compact and heavy ice-balls, in contrast to the target sense of snow as light ‘flakes’. \n    - Avoid terms specific to frost, i.e. frozen dew from condensation, in contrast to the target sense of perceptibly falling (flakes of) snow.  \n* The target sense here is of ‘rain’ as in turn a hypernym that covers a range of finer distinctions, for snow of different types, intensity or duration.  Avoid any such narrower terms, e.g. English _blizzard_, _snowstorm_, _sleet_.  \n* Enter the most generic term:  avoid terms specific to snow either while still falling, or while already on the ground.\n* The target sense is the literal one, for the weather phenomenon.  Avoid any lexemes that are predominantly extensions, e.g. to concepts of whiteness, purity, etc..\n* Avoid any technical, meteorological terms, including for different types of snow (e.g. for ski-ing, such as French _poudreuse_).    \n* See also, and contrast with, the definition of the separate IE-CoR meaning [rain](../wiki/Meaning:-rain)."

Do not provide technical terms, and do not be concerned if popular usage of the basic ‘star’ word can also extend beyond the technically correct:  e.g. English _shooting star_, or_morning/evening star_ to refer to the planet Venus.\n* The lexeme selected should normally be applicable to a single, standalone visible star, and will therefore normally be a singular.  Nonetheless, if the more basic lexeme in your language is a collective or non-count noun for ‘the stars’ in general (perhaps with single stars referred to by a singulative form), then that basic collective term can be entered instead. \n* Do not provide the proper name of any individual star, e.g. the _Pole Star_, _Arcturus_.\n* Do not enter terms that mean specifically the _sun_ (i.e. the earth’s star), which is a separate IE-CoR meaning [sun](../wiki/Meaning:-sun).\n* Avoid any terms that are used predominantly or only in more specific or figurative senses of ‘star’, e.g. for navigation (_lodestar, guiding star_), brightness, fame, or the figurative ‘star-shape’ (four, five or six-pointed)."

Avoid loaded terms that inherently carry more specific senses of any sort, e.g. personifications of the sun, the sun seen in religious or mystical senses, the sun as a source of light, warmth and growth, etc..\n* Avoid terms that inherently carry more specific senses of any type:\n    - Avoid terms that refer _primarily_ to the sun as the definition of _day_ as opposed to night.

177,throw,1456,THROW,"To cause (an object) to move rapidly through the air, with the force of the hand or arm.","##### Illustrative Context\n_**Throw** it so that I can catch it._\n\n##### Target Sense\n* The most basic verb that most naturally pairs with the verb ‘catch’, as in the illustrative context, e.g. English _throw_ or French _lancer_\n* The target sense is that of using the hand to cause something to move through the air, rather than on the ground.  The lexeme entered should be the basic verb that most expresses this contrast with other motion verbs, for which the movement is not through the air, e.g. _push_, _pull_, _roll_.  \n* Some languages may use a rather more general verb, not exclusively for motion through the air, e.g. Italian _tirare_, and/or may clarify that where necessary by explicitly adding phrases such as _in the air_, e.g. Spanish _tirar (al aire)_.  Provided that the verb alone is nonetheless the normal, basic word used for throwing, it should still be selected, as per normal IE-CoR policy to choose the most generic, common verb that also covers the target sense. \n* Avoid verbs that typically carry more specific overtones.  Many languages express these by morphological additions to the basic ‘throw’ verb (e.g. English _throw away_, _throw out_), in which case the basic root _throw_ remains the target lexeme.  But where multiple different verb roots exist, enter the most generic one most free of specific overtones, such as any of the following.\n    - Avoid verbs that imply a specific directional sense, and/or with overtones of throwing in order to strike a target, throwing _at_ (rather than _to_) someone or something, or into water, and so on.  \n    - Avoid verbs with inherent overtones of discarding or disposing of an object, i.e. _throw away_, _throw out_.  \n    - Avoid intensifying verbs for throwing particularly far or hard, or for violent or careless throwing, e.g. _hurl_, _sling_.  \n    - Avoid technical terminology or terminology of throwing specific types of object, e.g. _launch_.  \n    - Avoid non-default register words, such as colloquial English _chuck_, French _balancer_.\n* Some languages, particularly in the Romance family, have multiple close candidate lexemes for ‘throw’, so to determine the most appropriate lexeme in these languages requires targeting precisely the narrower sense described here, and the illustrative context.  French, for example, has two main translation equivalents for ‘throw’, _lancer_ and _jeter_, but the _for me to catch it_ part of the illustrative context identifies _lancer_ as more appropriate (_Lance-le pour que je l’atrappe_, rather than _Jette-le ..._).\n"

The basic lexeme may thus also extend beyond the prototypical case, e.g. in English a banana plant can also be popularly referred to as a ‘tree’.  This is not necessarily a concern:  the target lexeme should simply be the most basic one that would be applicable to the prototypical sense and illustrative context as defined above (and potentially also more broadly).  \n* Follow common usage and basic vocabulary.  Strict technical and biological classification criteria are not relevant — see also the definition for the separate IE-CoR meaning [ant](../wiki/Meaning:-ant).\n* Avoid lexemes that are hypernyms, not specific enough to a tree, e.g. _plant_.\n* Avoid lexemes that are hyponyms, i.e. narrower and more specific in any way, e.g.: \n    - Avoid terms that specifically denote relatively small scale, e.g. _bush_. \n    - Avoid terms that specifically refer to parts rather than the whole of a tree, e.g. _trunk_, _crown_, _wood_. \n    - Avoid terms for general types of tree (e.g. _conifer_), or specific species (e.g. _oak_).\n* If a language has no generic lexeme, and only distinct lexemes for different types of tree (e.g. evergreen vs. deciduous), then enter whichever of those terms is more basic or more common in the local context.  Only if no clear distinction can be made on those grounds, enter the term for the deciduous tree.\n* The term selected should be applicable to a single tree, and will thus normally be a singular noun.  Only in a language where the clearly most basic term is a collective, and where specifying a single tree would require additional singulative morphology, should a collective noun be entered instead.\n* Most languages will have clearly distinct lexemes for this meaning tree, and the separate IE-CoR meaning [forest](../wiki/Meaning:-forest).  Only in few languages might the basic lexeme be the same in both meanings, and distinguished just by additional morphology.\n* Compare with the similar approach to considerations of size in other separate IE-CoR meanings such as [river](../wiki/Meaning:-river), [bird](../wiki/Meaning:-bird) and [leaf](../wiki/Meaning:-leaf).)"

Although many such derivatives (with similar stems) may be available, select only the default, most general term. \n* Provide the **transitive** verb;  avoid different roots used for intransitives, reflexives, middles, etc..

Particular attention is needed with register for this meaning:  as per the IE-CoR policy guidelines, target the most neutral register term, neither too formal or euphemistic, nor too informal or vulgar.\n* Note that in some varieties of English,  the most neutral register term is not in fact _vomit_ but, for example _be sick_ (e.g. in the target variety in IE-CoR, namely British English in the lexical usage in England) or _throw up_.\n* Avoid marked higher register terms, e.g. formal or specifically medical ones.\n* Avoid marked euphemisms, unless an original euphemism has lost that connotation and has since become the neutral, direct term.\n* Many languages have multiple informal, slang or vulgar ‘synonyms’:  avoid all such terms. \n* The target lexeme may be morphologically complex in many languages, as for example in Slavic.

186,hot,1286,HOT,Having a very high temperature.,"##### Illustrative Context\n_The rocks get **hot** during the day and cold at night._  \n\n##### Target Sense\n* The default antonym of [cold](../wiki/Meaning:-cold). \n* The most basic term, typically adjectival, that covers the **largest span** of temperatures higher than neutral, and the **middle ground** of that span of temperatures (within sensible bounds of the usual temperature range in human experience).  \n* This should be a generic, relative term, not a specific and absolute one such as _boiling hot_.\n* Aim for the term covering the broadest range of tactile, ambient and personal uses.\n* Avoid marked, loaded, judgement terms for excessively hot, or not hot enough.\n* Avoid narrow terms limited to specific uses, e.g. hot only of food, only of liquids, only of weather, and so on.\n* Avoid resultative or change of state terms for _made hot_, _heated_.\n* Take the default, unmarked term, i.e. avoid intensifying terms for particularly hot, as well as qualifying, weakening terms such as (only) _warm_. \n* Many languages have just a single obvious default term, but others, particularly in the Germanic languages, have more than one common competing term, as in English _hot_ and _warm_, and their cognates in almost all other Germanic languages.  In English, _hot_ is more in line with the target, and slightly commoner than _warm_, which has a slightly narrower, more specific sense of ‘not especially hot’.  In German, _warm_ is slightly commoner than _heiß_, which has a slightly narrower, more specific sense of ‘particularly hot’.  In a proportion of cases, centered on our target sense, the translational equivalent of English _hot_ is actually often German _warm_.\n\n##### References\n* On the contrasts of tactile vs. ambient in the languages of Vanuatu and in Japanese, see François (2015).  \n* On the contrasts of tactile vs. ambient vs. personal, see Koptjeskaja-Tamm (2011)."

Technical, biological classificatory criteria are not relevant — see also the definition for the separate IE-CoR meaning [ant](../wiki/Meaning:-ant).\n* The lexeme chosen must be applicable to the prototype target case of (earth)worms (of medium size, c. 7 cm.), where this body form is that of the adult.  \n* It _may_ also be extendable to (generally smaller) ‘worms’ as can be found in fruit, such as an apple, in languages such as English where the same basic noun _worm_ can be applied to these as well as to (earth)worms.  \n* Avoid, however, terms specific only to worms in the form of _larvae_ or _maggots_, that refer specifically to a stage in the life-cycle of species whose adult body form is not that of a worm. \n* The lexeme should normally be a singular term.

So although technically, in biological classification, _ants_ and _termites_ are quite distinct families, what matters to IE-CoR is that popular usage often does not distinguish them in practice (and focuses instead on their similar form and behaviour as colony insects).  \n* So for this IE-CoR meaning too, please as usual provide the most default term in your language:\n- If the default term covers both ants and termites, then select that term.  This is effectively the case in English, for example, where most speakers take _ant_ as a hypernym, and _termite_ as a hyponym within it (irrespective of the techincal, biolgical classification).  So the correct IE-CoR term in English is indeed _ant_.  Many European languages are similar in this respect.\n- If your language has no such cover term, but has two distincI, non-overlapping lexemes for _ant_ vs. _termite_, then please select whichever of those is perceived as the more basic, default or common term in your language, whichever of ants or termites it technically refers to.  \n* Only if you really cannot choose between two equally basic terms, then select the one that refers to the technical _ant_ (i.e. of the family Formicidae) rather than _termite_.\n\n* If your language uses by default a term in the plural, or a non-count noun, enter that default form, and mention this in the notes field."

210,navel,1838,NAVEL,A scar where the umbilical cord was attached.,"##### Illustrative Context\n_You could see his **navel**._\n\n##### Target Sense\n* The default term for the navel or ‘belly-button’ (i.e. where the umbilical cord was once attached) as a part of the human body.\n* Enter the most normal, basic term in the language.\n    - Avoid lexemes that are higher-register, technical or medical terms, e.g. English (!) _umbilicus_.\n    - Avoid terms that are perceived as predominantly ‘baby-talk’ or unmistakably slang terms.  \n* In many languages there is an obvious straightforward term, e.g. French _nombril_, German _(Bauch)Nabel_.  In many varieties of English, however, there is in fact a difficult choice between higher-register _navel_ and colloquial register alternatives such as _belly-button_.  In the variety of (British) English targeted in IE-CoR, _belly-button_ is in fact selected as the more neutral, basic term on several IE-CoR criteria.  The term _navel_ is perceived as more markedly high-register than _belly-button_ is low-register.  Furthermore, the lexeme _navel_ is not part of the basic, early vocabulary of native learners, and is generally not acquired until relatively late.\n* Provide the basic term for the actual part of the human body. \n Avoid lexemes that predominantly carry figurative senses of origin, centre point, focal point or even rotation point, e.g. _navel of the world_.\n* As ever, etymology and congacy should **not** be a criterion in lexeme selection.  This is strict IE-CoR protocol in all cases, but re-emphasised here given the potential temptation with some of the Indo-European roots involved.  Lexeme determination should be guided by semantics, not etymology, and by the standard IE-CoR selection criteria.  \n\n"

218,go,695,GO,To move from a place to another that is further away.,"##### Illustrative Context\n_I saw him on the road. I don't know where he was **going**._\n\n##### Target Sense\n* The most basic, intransitive verb for changing location from one place to another place.  Often this will be the verb used in very generic expressions like ‘going from A to B’.  Note that this meaning is specifically **not** the sense of ‘walk’. \n* The priority is to select the most basic word that meets the definitions here.  This will be one of the commonest verbs in the language (and one of the first that a foreign learner would need to know).  In many languages it is easy to identify:  e.g. _go_, _aller_, _ir_.  (This frequency also means that your language's verb may be **suppletive**.  If so, then please see (below)[../wiki/go#suppletive-forms] for the special policy needed for which form(s) to enter.)  \n* On the other hand, many languages do not have a single generic verb corresponding to all of the broad scope of the English verb _go_, so particular care is needed to follow the specifications given here.  \n* Although most typically for ground travel by foot, in many languages the basic term is general enough to apply to various modes within a single ‘going’ from A to B.  (English _go_ can also cover a journey involving many different modes, even swimming, flying, etc.).   Nonetheless, always recall the criterion **basic**: do not select rare or technical words, just because they are carefully ambiguous between all possible modes:  so English _go_, not _move_, _travel_, etc..  \n* In many languages the most general ‘go’ verb is still transparently based on the more specific sense of going by foot, e.g. Italian _andare_ (from Latin _ambulare_).  Such a verb can and should be selected, provided that its semantic range has spread to become also the more general ‘go’, cover sense too.  On the other hand, avoid terms that _specifically_ and _exclusively_ mean going by foot, such as _walk_ or Italian _camminare_ (which has effectively moved into the more specific semantic slot once occupied by _ambulare_).  \n* The basic target sense is for movement by people, although the preferred generic word will often be applicable to animals too, or in some languages (like English _go_) also by vehicles.\n* The basic target sense is for people moving by themselves (typically walking).  So the verb selected should certainly not be one that exclusively refers to people travelling in vehicles and/or riding on animals.  So German _fahren_ is not to be selected, and _gehen_ instead.  \n* Prototypically the target sense is for deliberate movement, targeting the destination.  Avoid words that specifically mean non-targeted, multi-directional movement for the sake of the movement, rather than destination, e.g. avoid terms like _wander_, _amble_, _go for a walk_.\n* Prototypically the target sense is for covering some significant distance, not just adjusting position (_move_).  Also avoid words specifically for long distances that could only viably be covered in some vehicle.\n* Avoid any overly specific meanings, such as terms that emphasise speed (e.g. _run_), distance, and so on.\n* Do not consider grammatical uses of _go_-like words, such as progressive or future auxiliaries, inchoative verbs, etc..  \n\n##### Suppletive Forms!\nIt is particularly common that this verb is suppletive in Indo-European languages, and a very specific policy has to be adopted in this case.  Provide first the standard citation form in the language (often the infinitive).  However, if the third person singular present form uses a different root, then enter that too, separated by the ≠ character, as in the following examples for Romance languages \n* French:   `aller ≠ va`\n* Italian:  `andare ≠ va`\n* Spanish:  `ir ≠ va`  \n\nFor more details, see the guidance/help page on [how to deal with suppletion](../wiki/01--Policy-on-Verbal-Forms#dealing-with-verbal-suppletion)."

(I.e. both feet will be off the ground at some point while _running_, but not when _walking_.)\n\n* Avoid intensive terms, specific to running very fast or as fast as possible. \n* Avoid terms specifically for animals, where different.\n* Avoid terms with further, specific connotations, e.g. _jog_ as specifically running for the purpose of exercise.\n\nBeware the polysemy of English ‘run’:\n* Avoid terms for flowing or other movement of e.g. liquids, where different.\n* Avoid terms referring specifically to the ‘running’ of moving parts of machines.\n* Avoid terms that specifically mean ‘function’, ‘manage’, etc..\n\n"
220,carry,700,CARRY,To lift and bring to somewhere else; to transport by lifting.,"##### Illustrative Context\n_She **carried** her bag (under her arm)._\n\n##### Target Sense\n* The most generic transitive verb, prototypically for people carrying a load while walking, and which must be applicable in that context.\n* The term should be generic, free of more precise connotations as to the purpose of the carrying.  That is, avoid terms such as _bring_ or _deliver_.\n* Some languages distinguish multiple different verbs for different ways of carrying:  e.g. in the hand, over the shoulder, on the back.  In such cases, select whichever term is the least marked and specific, able to be used when the particular manner of carrying is unknown or unimportant.  Only where a language has no unmarked term, select the term for carrying under the arm (the most stable sub-meaning according to the World Loanword Database).\n* The term should be a literal one.  Avoid terms that are specifically or predominantly figurative, e.g. _bear_ a burden.\n* Avoid terms for wearing clothes, unless also the basic carry word in a language, e.g. French _porter_.\n* Avoid terms for simply holding something (up), without actually moving with it.\n"
221,take,1749,TAKE,To grasp with the hands.,"#### Illustrative Context\n_**Take** the money when you go._\n\n#### Target Sense\n* This is a complex semantic field, in which the English lexeme _take_ and its translation equivalents in many languages may cover many overlapping sub-senses.  \n* The IE-CoR target sense, as in the illustrative context, is that of moving an object by having it with you as you yourself move.  Typically this comes in natural combination with reference also to the necessary initial act of first taking that object into your ‘possession’ (whether temporary or permanent). \n\n* Select the most basic verb, which will typically be generic enough to cover both of these aspects together by default (even if it pragmatically, in appropriate contexts, it may also be interpretable as focused on just one of those two senses).  So in practice:\n    - Avoid lexemes inherently more narrowly restricted to or focused on the prerequisite act of removal, taking _away_ or taking possession (e.g. _grab_, _seize_), without also including the sense of moving (with) that object further.  \n    - Likewise, avoid lexemes inherently more narrowly restricted to the sense of just having an object with you as you move (e.g. _carry_, _bear_, _have on you_), without also including the sense of first taking possession of it. \n\n* The meaning here is not _carry_.  That is:  avoid lexemes that are more narrowly focused on a particular physical means by which an object is moved e.g. English _carry_, French _porter_, German _tragen_.\n* The meaning here is not _bring_.  That is:  the term selected should ideally be generic also in the sense of not being narrowly deictic and not focused on a particular direction of movement, e.g. French _prendre_ not _emporter_ nor _apporter_.  \n* Some languages may not have a basic generic cover-term lexeme, but only multiple narrower and explicitly deictic and directional verbs.  In such cases only, then select the verb with the deictic sense of _taking away from_ rather than _bringing towards_ the deictic reference point.  As in English, the most neutral verb may in appropriate contexts also allow of a more specific directional sense (usually the _away from_ direction, given the definition here).  This is not an issue so long as that basic lexeme is also used in deixis-free contexts.  In most English varieties, for example, if the deictic reference point is A, then one _takes_ from A to B, one _brings_ from B to A, but decisive for the IE-CoR definition is that one also  _takes_ (not _brings_) from B to C, where neither place is the deictic reference point.  \n* The lexeme selected must be applicable to objects small enough to be picked up and carried in the hand, as in the illustrative context.  It may also be applicable to larger objects, and indeed to _taking_ people and animals, in the sense of leading or even carrying them (e.g. for babies).  Do not, however, select a verb that is specific to _taking_ only people or animals (e.g. French _amener_, _emmener_), or specific to the sense of _lead_.\n* The lexeme selected must be applicable to things that can be taken in the hand, and moved by the person walking.  In many languages (including English) the most basic term may also cover _taking_ by vehicle.  In languages that have different verbs for taking by walking or by vehicle (as in many Slavic languages), do not select a verb that is specific to leading or _taking_ by vehicle.\n* Select the most neutral and generic lexeme, without any other additional meaning specification (wherever possible).  \n    - Avoid intensifying terms that emphasise the speed (or slowness) of taking possession, or the speed of movement with the thing taken.\n    - Avoid terms that emphasise the abruptness or force of taking possession:  e.g. _grab_, _seize_.\n    - Avoid terms that refer also to ownership or to the _taking_ as specifically temporary or permanent.  Especially avoid terms specific to the sense of _steal_. \n\n* On a morphological level, too, the most basic, neutral and generic lexeme will usually have the least additional morphology that might add more specific meaning specifications.  Within this semantic field, many languages have multiple derivational variants based around a basic root, e.g. English _take+away_ and German _mit+nehmen_.  Normally, if such morphology is still transparent, then enter the basic form of the lexeme, without additional morphemes.  So the lexeme in English is just plain _take_, in German just plain _nehmen_.  \n* Nonetheless, _deep_ etymology is not relevant.  Original additional morphology can become fused and lose its original specifying sense, and/or an original bare root may no longer exist alone.  French _prendre_ is the basic and correct term in this meaning, as it has long since been reanalysed as a single root morpheme, even if ultimately derived with an original Latin prefix _pre-_. \n\n\n\n"

223,cry,1839,CRY,To shed tears due to the impact of an emotion.,"##### Illustrative Context\n_She was **crying** when I saw her._\n\n##### Disambiguation\n* Beware the ambiguity of the English lexeme _cry_.  The sense targeted here is the basic meaning of the bare root _cry_ in modern spoken English, i.e. _cry_ as _shed tears_.  \n* Do **not** consider the sense of _cry (out)_ as _shout_.  Usage of the bare root _cry_ — i.e. unsupported by _out_, _aloud_, etc. — is increasingly rare in this sense, except in the written register.\n\n##### Target Sense\n* The most generic verb for people shedding tears.\n* By default the context will be one of strong emotion, prototypically sadness but also pain or joy.  \n* Avoid terms for accompanying emotions but which do not specifically mean shedding tears, e.g. _lament_, _bewail_.\n* Avoid terms, if different, simply for physiological reactions of the eye, unconnected with emotion, e.g. _eyes watering_.\n"
224,do,813,DO,"To act, to behave.","##### Illustrative Context\n_What did you **do** in the village yesterday?_\n\n##### Target Sense\n* The most generic verb for carrying out an activity or action.\n* The basic meaning should be just of performing an activity, not for creating an object which _results_ from the activity..  So avoid terms like English _make_, which have specifically that sense, in opposition to a more general _do_ word.  Note that in German, however, the cognate word _machen_ is now also a generic _do_ word, not specific to making objects, and therefore does fit the target sense here.\n* Avoid auxiliaries if they have a different form to the main content verb.\n\n"
225,grind,1033,GRIND,"To break something into small pieces by pressing it flat, or grinding it to powder.","##### Illustrative Context\n_He is **grinding** the nuts._\n\n##### Target Sense\n* The most generic transitive verb for grinding, in the following prototypical sense and context:  to break up a hard, dry substance, particularly foodstuffs such as nuts, seeds or beans (e.g. coffee), into powdery or granular form, by a crushing, rotating action with a hard implement, typically stone (or metal) .  The lexeme selected must be the basic term used in this prototypical case, although it may also be applicable more widely across other similar contexts.\n* In many languages the same basic lexeme is used for turning cereal grains into flour.  Where a language has a different lexeme specific to this case, however, then do not provide this narrower lexeme, but the more general one.  So in English the correct English lexeme is thus more general _grind_, not narrower _mill_.\n* In many languages an adjectival form derived from the same verb is used to describe the result:  e.g. English _grind_ -> _ground_ (e.g. nuts, almonds, coffee);  French _moudre_ -> _moulu_;  German _mahlen_ -> _gemahlen_, etc..\n* Avoid terms such as _mash_ or _pulp_ that refer to similar actions, but with moist or wet substances.\n* Avoid terms such as _pound_ or _stamp_ that imply repeated directional blows, rather than the crushing, rotating movement of ‘grind’.\n* Avoid terms such as _squeeze_, _crush_, that focus on prolonged pressure, rather than the process of reducing to granular form.\n* Avoid intensifying terms with a specific emphasis on the desintegration or destruction, or that imply using particular force, e.g. German _zermalmen_. \n* Avoid terms that focus on a ‘grinding’ _noise_, of hard objects in contact and friction, e.g. of brakes, teeth, etc..\n"
226,claw,72,CLAW,"A curved pointed appendage, found at the end of a toe or finger or, in arthropods, of the tarsus.","##### Illustrative Context\n_The cat scratched me with its **claws**._\n\n##### Target Sense\n* The most generic term for the sharp, pointed, curved and horny body-part at the end of the toes of an animal.  As a prototypical case, take the claws of an animal like a cat (except if a language happens to have a narrow term specific to the claws of a cat, in which case select whatever other term is most generic).  \n* In many languages, the generic term is also applicable to a bird's claws.  Nonetheless, the target sense here is the hard, inflexible and already curved body-part at the end of the toe, that can scratch or snag on a surface (like a cat’s claws).  Do not confuse this with (nor select) words that have more the sense of _talons_ (e.g. of a bird of prey), that can refer to the whole set of toes that can physically grab, grasp, grip and hold an object (a branch, or prey) by muscles.  \n* Some languages have the same basic lexeme for both IE-CoR meanings ‘claw’ and [nail](../wiki/nail), without generally making a distinction between them.  In such cases then that same term should be entered for both meanings in that language.\n* However, if a language does, like English, have a (common register) distinction between the largely flat, protective covering _nail_ on human fingers, versus the curved, pointed _claw_ on the toes of an animal like a cat, then select the latter here, in contrast to the entry for [nail](../wiki/nail).  \n* In some languages, the basic word tends to be used more (or even exclusively) in the plural, e.g. Spanish _garras_, even to an extent English _claws_ itself.  If distinctly more natural in your language, simply enter the plural form.  (The key interest in IE-CoR is in the cognacy status of the root used in the target meaning, not in the morphology of singular vs. plural.)  \n\n"

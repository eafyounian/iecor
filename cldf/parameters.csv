218,go,,695,GO,To move from a place to another that is further away.,"##### Illustrative Context\n_I saw him on the road. I don't know where he was **going**._\n\n##### Target Sense\n* The most basic, intransitive verb for changing location from one place to another place.  Often this will be the verb used in very generic expressions like ‘going from A to B’.  Note that this meaning is specifically **not** the sense of ‘walk’. \n* The priority is to select the most basic word that meets the definitions here.  This will be one of the commonest verbs in the language (and one of the first that a foreign learner would need to know).  In many languages it is easy to identify:  e.g. _go_, _aller_, _ir_.  (This frequency also means that your language's verb may be **suppletive**.  If so, then please see (below)[../wiki/go#suppletive-forms] for the special policy needed for which form(s) to enter.)  \n* On the other hand, many languages do not have a single generic verb corresponding to all of the broad scope of the English verb _go_, so particular care is needed to follow the specifications given here.  \n* Although most typically for ground travel by foot, in many languages the basic term is general enough to apply to various modes within a single ‘going’ from A to B.  (English _go_ can also cover a journey involving many different modes, even swimming, flying, etc.).   Nonetheless, always recall the criterion **basic**: do not select rare or technical words, just because they are carefully ambiguous between all possible modes:  so English _go_, not _move_, _travel_, etc..  \n* In many languages the most general ‘go’ verb is still transparently based on the more specific sense of going by foot, e.g. Italian _andare_ (from Latin _ambulare_).  Such a verb can and should be selected, provided that its semantic range has spread to become also the more general ‘go’, cover sense too.  On the other hand, avoid terms that _specifically_ and _exclusively_ mean going by foot, such as _walk_ or Italian _camminare_ (which has effectively moved into the more specific semantic slot once occupied by _ambulare_).  \n* The basic target sense is for movement by people, although the preferred generic word will often be applicable to animals too, or in some languages (like English _go_) also by vehicles.\n* The basic target sense is for people moving by themselves (typically walking).  So the verb selected should certainly not be one that exclusively refers to people travelling in vehicles and/or riding on animals.  So German _fahren_ is not to be selected, and _gehen_ instead.  \n* Prototypically the target sense is for deliberate movement, targeting the destination.  Avoid words that specifically mean non-targeted, multi-directional movement for the sake of the movement, rather than destination, e.g. avoid terms like _wander_, _amble_, _go for a walk_.\n* Prototypically the target sense is for covering some significant distance, not just adjusting position (_move_).  Also avoid words specifically for long distances that could only viably be covered in some vehicle.\n* Avoid any overly specific meanings, such as terms that emphasise speed (e.g. _run_), distance, and so on.\n* Do not consider grammatical uses of _go_-like words, such as progressive or future auxiliaries, inchoative verbs, etc..  \n\n##### Suppletive Forms!\nIt is particularly common that this verb is suppletive in Indo-European languages, and a very specific policy has to be adopted in this case.  Provide first the standard citation form in the language (often the infinitive).  However, if the third person singular present form uses a different root, then enter that too, separated by the ≠ character, as in the following examples for Romance languages \n* French:   `aller ≠ va`\n* Italian:  `andare ≠ va`\n* Spanish:  `ir ≠ va`  \n\nFor more details, see the guidance/help page on [how to deal with suppletion](../wiki/01--Policy-on-Verbal-Forms#dealing-with-verbal-suppletion)."

The target sense for IE-CoR is a small, hard and dry type of seed, prototypically roundish, as would be pecked at by small birds, e.g. mustard seeds or slightly larger. \n- Aim for the most basic, generic term, which in particular should be applicable to more than just cereals.  It will normally be applicable to many flowers and relatively small plants, irrespective of whether they are a food source for humans. \n- Avoid terms that focus on seeds viewed specifically as a food source, to be ground into flour or otherwise eaten.  \n- Focus on the sense of an individual seed, in preference to a collective, non-count noun, e.g. French 'graine', not 'semence' (in some languages this may mean a singulative is appropriate).\n- Avoid terms closer to English 'nut', relatively larger and viewed as a food source.\n- Avoid terms specific to the stony cores of fruit such as a peach or avocado.\n- Avoid technical botanical or agricultural terms.\n\n"

Avoid terms specific to any such senses, however, and which are not the default word for the human leg.\n* Where a language uses the same basic lexeme for _foot_ as well as _leg_ (e.g. Russian _нога_), with no basic term specific to _leg_ in contrast with _foot_, then that lexeme may be selected here, as well as for the separate IE-CoR meaning [foot](../wiki/Meaning:-foot).  Indicate this in the notes field."
220,carry,,700,CARRY,To lift and bring to somewhere else; to transport by lifting.,"##### Illustrative Context\n_She **carried** her bag (under her arm)._\n\n##### Target Sense\n* The most generic transitive verb, prototypically for people carrying a load while walking, and which must be applicable in that context.\n* The term should be generic, free of more precise connotations as to the purpose of the carrying.  That is, avoid terms such as _bring_ or _deliver_.\n* Some languages distinguish multiple different verbs for different ways of carrying:  e.g. in the hand, over the shoulder, on the back.  In such cases, select whichever term is the least marked and specific, able to be used when the particular manner of carrying is unknown or unimportant.  Only where a language has no unmarked term, select the term for carrying under the arm (the most stable sub-meaning according to the World Loanword Database).\n* The term should be a literal one.  Avoid terms that are specifically or predominantly figurative, e.g. _bear_ a burden.\n* Avoid terms for wearing clothes, unless also the basic carry word in a language, e.g. French _porter_.\n* Avoid terms for simply holding something (up), without actually moving with it.\n"

That is, select the 'throw' verb that most expresses this contrast vis à vis other motion verbs where the movement is not through the air, e.g. _push_, _pull_, _roll_.  \n\nSome languages may use a rather more general verb, not necessarily exclusively for motion through the air, e.g. Italian 'tirare', and/or may clarify that where necessary by explicitly adding phrases such as 'in the air', e.g. Spanish 'tirar (al aire)'.  Provided that the verb alone is nonetheless the normal, basic word used for throwing, it should still be selected, as per normal IE-CoR policy to choose the most generic, common verb that also covers the target sense. \n\nAvoid verbs that typically carry more specific overtones, such as any of the following.  Many languages will express these by morphological additions to the basic 'throw' verb (such as English _throw away_, _throw out_), in which case the basic root _throw_ is still fine.  But where multiple different verb roots exist, favour the most generic one that is the most free of specific overtones such as these.\n\n- Avoid verbs that imply a specific directional sense, and/or with overtones of throwing in order to strike a target, throwing 'at' someone or something, or into water, and so on.  \n- Avoid verbs with overtones of discarding or disposing of an object, i.e. 'throw away', 'throw out'.  \n- Avoid intensifying verbs for throwing particularly far or hard, or for violent or careless throwing, e.g. 'hurl', 'sling'.  \n- Avoid technical terminology or terminology of throwing specific types of object, e.g. 'launch'.  \n- Avoid non-default register words, such as colloquial English 'chuck', French 'balancer'.\n\n"

224,do,.,813,DO,"To act, to behave.","##### Illustrative Context\n_What did you **do** in the village yesterday?_\n\n##### Target Sense\n* The most generic verb for carrying out an activity or action.\n* The basic meaning should be just of performing an activity, not for creating an object which _results_ from the activity..  So avoid terms like English _make_, which have specifically that sense, in opposition to a more general _do_ word.  Note that in German, however, the cognate word _machen_ is now also a generic _do_ word, not specific to making objects, and therefore does fit the target sense here.\n* Avoid auxiliaries if they have a different form to the main content verb.\n\n"

So although technically, in biological classification, _ants_ and _termites_ are quite distinct families, what matters to IE-CoR is that popular usage often does not distinguish them in practice (and focuses instead on their similar form and behaviour as colony insects).  \n* So for this IE-CoR meaning too, please as usual provide the most default term in your language:\n- If the default term covers both ants and termites, then select that term.  This is effectively the case in English, for example, where most speakers take _ant_ as a hypernym, and _termite_ as a hyponym within it (irrespective of the techincal, biolgical classification).  So the correct IE-CoR term in English is indeed _ant_.  Many European languages are similar in this respect.\n- If your language has no such cover term, but has two distincI, non-overlapping lexemes for _ant_ vs. _termite_, then please select whichever of those is perceived as the more basic, default or common term in your language, whichever of ants or termites it technically refers to.  \n* Only if you really cannot choose between two equally basic terms, then select the one that refers to the technical _ant_ (i.e. of the family Formicidae) rather than _termite_.\n\n* If your language uses by default a term in the plural, or a non-count noun, enter that default form, and mention this in the notes field."

Avoid terms restricted to figurative senses, such as 'difficult', 'serious', 'taxing', 'uncomfortable'.  \n* In some languages the adjectival form may be morphologically complex, often derived from a basic verbal root for 'weigh, be heavy', e.g. Spanish _pesado_ and Italian _pesante_.  Provided that such a derivation has become the default adjectival form for 'heavy' in a given language, then that is the appropriate lexeme to select for that language.

Must be able to refer to the dust kicked up from dry earth, as in the illustrative context.  \n* In most languages the generic term will also be applicable more widely, including to the dust that gathers over time on surfaces within buildings.  Do not, however, select a term specific only to such dust within buildings.\n* Avoid terms that specifically mean _ash_.  Only if a language has a single basic term that covers both _ash_ and _dust_ (e.g. Hittite, Ancient Greek, Old Irish) should the same lexeme be selected both here for ‘dust’ and for the distinct IE-CoR meaning [ash](../wiki/Meaning:-ash)."

The meaning here is _ash_ as the remains of burnt materials, **not** the tree species _ash_.\n\n##### Target Sense\n* Ash as the generic word for the powdery remains from burning many materials, such as wood, grass or dry dung.\n* The lexeme must be applicable to **cold** ash.  Avoid words that refer specifically to still hot _embers_.\n* The lexeme must be applicable to ash as reduced to **powder**.  Avoid words that can refer to material not fully burnt and still solid, objects that are merely charred or blackened.\n* The lexeme must be applicable to ash that is **white/grey** in colour, and not just charred black _soot_. \n* The generic term for the **substance**.  In many languages this will be a mass/non-count noun, as in English ‘singular’ _ash_ or French _(la) cendre_.  In such cases, provide this mass or ‘singular’ form, especially if plural forms have more specific senses, such as _ash**es**_ or _(les) cendre**s**_ — see the next bullet point.\n* Avoid words with the specific sense of the burnt remains of a particular thing, or indeed a body, and/or the results of a deliberate act of cremation, e.g. Russian _прах_ or the usage of the plural _ash**es**_ in English.\n "

The lexeme selected must be able to be used in that context, although will normally have much wider applicability too, to animals eating, and to most or all other foods.\n* The default register term:  avoid polite or euphemistic words (e.g. English _dine_, German _speisen_, Russian _кушать_), slang (e.g. French _bouffer_), nursery words (e.g. _munch_), etc..\n* The general sense of taking food into the body, without focusing on any particular way of eating or muscular action in the mouth, i.e. avoid specific terms like _chew_, _nibble_, _swallow_, etc..  (Note that language change can alter the specificity of such words.  The Latin word _manducare_ originally meant ‘chew’, and thus is not the IE-CoR lexeme for ‘eat’ in Classical Latin. Nonetheless, that word root has since given rise to Italian _mangiare_ and French _manger_.  These no longer bear any of the original connotation of specifically ‘chew’, and have become the default, unmarked lexemes for the IE-CoR meaning ‘eat’ in these languages.)\n* Avoid intensifying verbs, e.g. _eat up_, _devour_.\n* If a language has different default words used with different types of food (e.g. meat, cereals, fruits/nuts, hard food, soft food, liquid food, etc.), then select the most generic word.  If no term can be identified as more generic than others, select the verb used for eating the most basic, traditional foodstuff for most speakers of that language:  e.g. rice, bread, maize, etc., as appropriate.  This should therefore also be the most statistically frequent ‘eat’ verb in that language. \n* The literal sense of eating, i.e. avoid figurative senses of things being _eaten away (at)_, gradually losing mass or emotionally undermined by. \n\n"
28,die,,1494,DIE,To cease to live.,"##### Illustrative Context\n_Everyone **dies** sooner or later._\n\n##### Target Sense\n* The most generic verb for the death of people, non-specific as to cause.  \n* The lexeme selected must be applicable to humans, although in many languages will also serve for animals and plants. \n* Avoid terms specifically for dying ‘of old age’, or specific to any other cause. \n* The most neutral register, literal term.  Avoid lexemes that are emotionally charged (e.g. _perish_), euphemistic or polite (e.g. _pass (away)), literary (e.g. _expire_) or slang (e.g. _kick the bucket_).  \n* The basic term in a language may of course have originated in some such register, but since lost those connotations and become simply the normal default term for ‘die’.  If so, then it is indeed now the lexeme in the IE-CoR target sense, and should be selected. \n* Avoid terms with specific connotations of violent death.\n"

E.g. in German the target lexeme is _zählen_, not _rechnen_.  \n* Select the basic term for counting actual things in concrete cases — i.e. avoid terms specifically for reciting a numeral sequence in the abstract.\n* Avoid technical and mathematical terms like _enumerate_.\n\n\n"

Certainly avoid technical terms such as _ovum_, and terms limited to specific types of biological egg, e.g. _frogspawn_.\n* Avoid terms limited to eggs seen as food.\n\n "

Avoid, however, any verb that is limited to these senses.  The verb selected must be applicable to falling from a height, as in the illustrative context.\n* In many languages the basic verb may be applicable to objects falling as well as to people (as in the illustrative context).  Avoid, however, verbs applicable only to objects falling.  The verb selected must be applicable to people falling.\n* Avoid terms with more specific senses of falling _off_ a surface, _tripping up_, _tipping over_, etc..\n* Avoid terms that include reference or implications of the cause of falling.\n"

7,bad,,1292,BAD,Not good; unfavorable; negative.,"#### Illustrative Context\n_That isn’t a good idea, it’s a **bad** idea._\n\n#### Target Sense\n* The most generic, default, unmarked adjective for negative judgement, as an antonym of [good](/wiki/Meaning:-good).  \n* The target sense is a general judgement of negative, i.e. deleterious or inappropriate in the current context.  \nBeware the wide polysemy of the English word _bad_.  \n* Avoid terms specific to the sense of _morally_ wrong or _evil_.  There is no necessary implication of this in the IE-CoR target sense of ‘bad’.\n* Avoid terms for other specific sub-senses of English ‘bad’, e.g. words that mean specifically ‘rotten’, ‘angry’, etc.. \n* Avoid marked, intensifying words, such as _terrible_, _horrible_.\n* Some languages may not have a straightforward candidate lexeme for this target sense.  In such cases, as well as the illustrative context given above, consider also which term for ‘bad’ works well in a wider variety of usage contexts. \n* Occasional languages (e.g. Cuzco Quechua) may even lack a default generic adjective for ‘bad’, and instead use just a negation of their lexeme for ‘good’.  It is possible to enter this ‘not good’ combination as the lexeme for this meaning, but only in languages where there is no viable simple adjective for negative judgement."

48,fight,,1423,FIGHT,To be involved in a physical confrontation.,"##### Illustrative Context\n_The two men are **fighting** outside._\n\n##### Target Sense\n* The most generic intransitive verb for fighting in the literal sense of physical confrontation with blows.  \n* In many languages, the equivalent of English intransitive _fight_ may be a reciprocal/reflexive or middle, e.g. French _se battre_.\n* The generic term may also extend to fighting with weapons, and at a distance.  Avoid words limited to those specific senses, however.  The lexeme selected must be applicable also to physical fighting without weapons.  \n* Avoid terms for organised warfare, e.g. _battle_, where different.\n* Default register:  avoid elevated, literary terms (e.g. _combat_) and slang (e.g. _scrap_).\n* Avoid more terms specific to particular types of fighting, e.g. _wrestle_.\n* Avoid terms that are predominantly figurative, i.e. ‘fighting’ in the sense of merely competing or striving against others or for a goal, e.g. _struggle_."
29,dig,,1418,DIG,"To move earth, rocks, etc. out of the way, usually to create a hole.","##### Illustrative Context\n_He is **digging** in the ground._\n\n##### Target Sense\n* The most generic verb for digging (by people), typically to create a hole, by removing earth, soil, sand, etc..\n* Prototypically an intransitive verb for the general activity of digging.  In a language where the basic verb is only transitive, then the object should be the _hole_ dug, not an object uncovered by digging.\n* Avoid terms specific to the (transitive) sense of uncovering _something_ buried underground (whether coming across it by chance or intentionally searching for it), i.e. digging _for_ something, or digging something _up_ or _out_.\n* Also avoid terms specific to digging a hole in order to bury something, including verbs specific to digging a grave for a body.  Indeed, obviously avoid verbs for _bury_, that include the sense of filling back in and covering up whatever is placed in the hole dug.\n* Avoid terms specific to digging with a certain instrument, e.g. _shovelling_.\n* Avoid technical or high-register terms, e.g. _excavate_.\n"

213,shadow,,2275,SHADOW,"Darkness, where light (particularly sunlight) is blocked.",#### Illustrative Context\n_He could see his **shadow** on the ground._\n\n#### Target Sense\nTerm for the area of darkness caused by the human body blocking out the light of the sun.\n\n#### justification
45,fear,,1419,FEAR (BE AFRAID),To be scared of; to have an uncontrollable emotion of anxiety about something that causes a scared reaction or frightening impression.,"##### Illustrative Context\n_While the dog was here, I **was scared**._\n\n**Note:** the English lexeme _fear_ as a verb is for most speakers now a somewhat limited, formal or old usage. (The noun _fear_ remains very common.)  On these grounds, following the IE-CoR policy on register, the lexeme selected in English is (the more default register) _be afraid_ or _be scared_, depending on variety.\n\n\n##### Target Sense\n* The target sense is intransitive, i.e. for _being afraid_, not being afraid _of something_. \n* The target sense is stative, i.e. the condition of _being afraid_, so avoid change-of-state terms that mean _get frightened_, where different.\n* Depending on the language, the default intransitive form may be either marked or unmarked vis à vis the transitive form;  please nonetheless provide the intransitive.\n* There is no requirement or expectation for a simplex verb form like _fear_.  On the contrary, do not supply one if the basic expression in your language uses some other construction.  E.g. in French, the basic term is not _craindre_ but _avoir peur_.  Indeed in this particular meaning there is a great deal of variation in the precise constructions used across different languages, for example:\n    - Latin (rather unusually) does have an unmarked intransitive _temere_.\n    - Greek and Old Irish use a middle voice.\n    - Slavic uses a reflexive verb.\n    - Many West European languages have moved to light verb constructions such as _have_ + noun, e.g. German _Angst haben_, or French _avoir peur_.\n    - English has _be_ + adjective _afraid_ or _scared_.\n    - Irish has _be_ with non-canonical subject marking + noun.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

184,vomit,,1278,VOMIT,To regurgitate the contents of the stomach.,"#### Illustrative Context\n_He ate something bad and **vomited**._\n\n#### Target Sense\nThe most generic term for regurgitating the contents of the stomach. \nThere may be register difficulties with this meaning in many languages.   As per the IE-CoR policy guidelines, target the most neutral register term.\n* Avoid marked higher register terms, e.g. formal or specifically medical ones.\n* Avoid marked euphemisms, unless an original euphemism has lost that connotation and has since become the neutral, direct term.\n* Avoid terms considered to be of vulgar register.\n* Note that in some varieties of English, the most neutral register term is not in fact _vomit_ but, for example _be sick_ (in British English), or _throw up_.\n* The target lexeme may be morphologically complex in many languages, as for example in Slavic.

17,bone,,1394,BONE,"Any of the components of an endoskeleton, consisting mainly of calcium phosphate, collagen and cells.","##### Illustrative Context\n_He fell and broke a **bone**._\n\n##### Target Sense\n* Most generic term, and which must be applicable to bones of the human body.\n* In many languages, the generic term will be widely applicable to the bones of animals, too.  Avoid, however, terms specific to certain animals or fish, e.g. French _arête_ (fishbone).\n* Avoid terms specific to ‘bone’ as a substance, e.g. of which things can be made.  The term must be applicable to an actual bone, e.g. in a skeleton.\n* Avoid any more limited terms that are specific only to certain types of bone (e.g. _antlers_), or to certain uses (e.g. for food), and so on. \n\n\n"

166,swim,,1439,SWIM,"To move through the water, without touching the bottom.",#### Illustrative Context\n_He is **swimming** in the lake._\n\n#### Target Sense\nMost generic intransitive verb for human self-motion in water (without touching the bottom).\n\n#### justification
226,claw,,72,CLAW,"A curved pointed appendage, found at the end of a toe or finger or, in arthropods, of the tarsus.","##### Illustrative Context\n_The cat scratched me with its **claws**._\n\n##### Target Sense\n* The most generic term for the sharp, pointed, curved and horny body-part at the end of the toes of an animal.  As a prototypical case, take the claws of an animal like a cat (except if a language happens to have a narrow term specific to the claws of a cat, in which case select whatever other term is most generic).  \n* In many languages, the generic term is also applicable to a bird's claws.  Nonetheless, the target sense here is the hard, inflexible and already curved body-part at the end of the toe, that can scratch or snag on a surface (like a cat’s claws).  Do not confuse this with (nor select) words that have more the sense of _talons_ (e.g. of a bird of prey), that can refer to the whole set of toes that can physically grab, grasp, grip and hold an object (a branch, or prey) by muscles.  \n* Some languages have the same basic lexeme for both IE-CoR meanings ‘claw’ and [nail](../wiki/nail), without generally making a distinction between them.  In such cases then that same term should be entered for both meanings in that language.\n* However, if a language does, like English, have a (common register) distinction between the largely flat, protective covering _nail_ on human fingers, versus the curved, pointed _claw_ on the toes of an animal like a cat, then select the latter here, in contrast to the entry for [nail](../wiki/nail).  \n* In some languages, the basic word tends to be used more (or even exclusively) in the plural, e.g. Spanish _garras_, even to an extent English _claws_ itself.  If distinctly more natural in your language, simply enter the plural form.  (The key interest in IE-CoR is in the cognacy status of the root used in the target meaning, not in the morphology of singular vs. plural.)  \n\n"
49,nail,"Nail of a finger/toe, not for hammering.",1896,FINGERNAIL OR TOENAIL,Hard keratin part growing at the end of a human's finger or toe.,"#### Illustrative Context\n_He had very long **nails** on his fingers._\n\n#### Target Sense\n* Term for the part of the human body, at the end of a finger or toe.  \n* Beware the polysemy of English 'nail':  not to be confused with a metal nail for hammering!\n* If your language has a generic term for the nails of both fingers and toes, that should be chosen, e.g. English 'nail'.\n* If your language has no generic term, then select then the word for the nail of a finger, not a toe.\n* Enter only the root that refers to the 'nail' part -- avoid entering a compounded element that literally means 'finger'. \n* The correct lexeme in English is thus _nail_, not _fingernail_.\n* You should normally give the singular form -- avoid collectives, unless that is the default base form in your language, and additional morphology is required to specify a singulative.\n* Swadesh lists sometimes vacillated between 'nail' of a human and '[claw](https://github.com/lingdb/CoBL-public/wiki/claw)' of an animal, but IE-CoR distinguishes these as separate entries.  In your language, the same lexeme may be the same for both of these IE-CoR meanings (a co-lexification).  This is not necessarily a problem, and you should certainly not specifically seek out two different terms to distinguish the two.  If both IE-CoR meanings 'nail' and '[claw](https://github.com/lingdb/CoBL-public/wiki/claw)' fall within the usage of a single basic lexeme in your language, it is fine to enter that lexeme for both IE-CoR meanings, as per our [standard policy](https://github.com/lingdb/CoBL-public/wiki/01--Policy-on-Selecting-Lexemes#what-is-your-task-for-cobl) to enter the single most general, basic and default  lexeme in your language that also naturally includes in its scope the IE-CoR target sense.

61,fruit,,1507,FRUIT,A botanical fruit that can be eaten raw used as food,"##### Illustrative Context\n_He picked **fruit** from the trees._\n\n##### Target Sense\n* The most generic term for fruit that can be eaten as food, typically fruit of a tree. \n* The most basic term may be collective rather than singular (perhaps with additional morphology to mark a singulative form). Provide whichever is the base form in the language.  \n* The literal term for edible fruit.  Avoid terms specific to figurative or metaphorical senses, e.g. _the fruit(s) of one’s labour_. \n* Avoid terms specific to any particular sort of fruit, such as terms specialised for smaller fruit, e.g. _berry_.\n"
62,full,,1429,FULL,Containing the most or maximum amount possible in the given available space.,"##### Illustrative Context\n_An empty pot is easier to carry than a **full** pot._\n\n##### Target Sense\n* The most generic adjective for containing the maximum amount of something in a given space.\n* Avoid terms with specific overt reference to maximum capacity, e.g. _full up_, _overflowing_.\n* Avoid derived, resultative terms meaning _filled_, unless such a derived form has replaced the original ‘full’ root to become the default term, without retaining a specific resultative sense.\n* Avoid terms specific to particular objects or liquids that a vessel is full of. \n"
65,grass,,606,GRASS,"A very large and widespread family of Monocotyledoneae, with more than 10.000 species, most of which are herbaceous, but a few are woody.

The flowers are inconspicuous, with a much reduced perianth, and are wind-pollinated or cleistogamous.","#### Illustrative Context\n_There is **grass** growing beside the river._\n\n#### Target Sense\n* The most generic term for grass as a general type of plant.  \n* In many languages, this generic term will also be the term used to refer to grass in the more specific context of the primary food source for grazing animals (wild and/or domesticated) such as horses, cattle and sheep.  Do not, however, select a lexeme that is specific to this sense of grass as animal food.  Avoid, therefore, terms restricted to this narrower sense, i.e. terms equivalent to English _fodder_, _pasture_ or indeed _grassland_, rather than just the basic word for the plant (type). \n \n\n"

For _fly_ this can correspond to an opposition between:\n    - a neutral iterable verb _fly_, e.g. _Where is that bird flying to?_\n    - a habitual verb _fly_ (often morphologically more marked), e.g. _Little chicks don’t yet know how to fly_.  \n\n* In such cases, if neither root is more basic or default than the other, then exceptionally, both may be entered as synonyms.

223,cry,"The sense of shedding tears, not shouting out.",1839,CRY,To shed tears due to the impact of an emotion.,"##### Illustrative Context\n_She was **crying** when I saw her._\n\n##### Disambiguation\n* Beware the ambiguity of the English lexeme _cry_.  The sense targeted here is the basic meaning of the bare root _cry_ in modern spoken English, i.e. _cry_ as _shed tears_.  \n* Do **not** consider the sense of _cry (out)_ as _shout_.  Usage of the bare root _cry_ — i.e. unsupported by _out_, _aloud_, etc. — is increasingly rare in this sense, except in the written register.\n\n##### Target Sense\n* The most generic verb for people shedding tears.\n* By default the context will be one of strong emotion, prototypically sadness but also pain or joy.  \n* Avoid terms for accompanying emotions but which do not specifically mean shedding tears, e.g. _lament_, _bewail_.\n* Avoid terms, if different, simply for physiological reactions of the eye, unconnected with emotion, e.g. _eyes watering_.\n"
50,fire,,221,FIRE,"The state of combustion in which inflammable material burns, producing heat, flames and often smoke.","##### Illustrative Context \n_He was cold, so he moved closer to the **fire**._\n\n##### Target Sense\n* Most generic, basic and default noun for _fire_, preferably applicable both to the concept of fire in general, and to a concrete instance of (a) fire.\n* In many languages this will be the same term as used in the traditional Classical concept of the four ‘elements’, i.e. _fire_ as opposed to _earth_, _air_ and _water_.\n* The lexeme selected should fit the target context (as in the illustrative context sentence) of a relatively small fire, controlled and intentionally set, for heating or cooking.\n* The lexeme selected should normally refer to fire visible in the form of flame(s), but avoid terms that have the narrower and more specific meaning of _flame_ rather than fire in general.\n* Avoid terms with specific narrower and limiting senses or usage of any kind, e.g..:\n    - Terms that are more limited to the abstract concept of _combustion_.  Indeed, avoid technical register terms such as English _combustion_.\n    - Terms specific to particular _types_ of fire, such as fire burning down a building,  e.g. French _incendie_ (rather than the correct generic word _feu_).\n    - Terms with specific senses of intense, uncontrolled, damaging and dangerous fire, e.g. _blaze_.\n    - Terms with a specific sense of a naturally occurring fire, e.g. _wildfire_, _bush fire_.\n    - Terms specific to _indoor_ fires, fireplaces or hearths, e.g. French _foyer_ (even if ultimately derived from the same root as correct _feu_).\n\n**Note:** the illustrative case of modern Romance languages derive their modern default _fire_ words not from the original Classical Latin _ignis_, but from the Latin word _focus_, which _originally_ meant only ‘fireplace’.  Regardless of that derivation and original sense, though, the cognates of _focus_ have in modern Romance languages long since broadened semantically to displace the _ignis_ root entirely, and take over its semantic slot as the basic _fire_ word here.  So the correct target lexemes for these languages in IE-CoR are indeed _feu_, _fuoco_, _fuego_, etc..\n\n\n\n\n"
59,four,,1500,FOUR,"The cardinal number occurring after three and before five, represented in Roman numerals as IV, in Arabic numerals as 4.","##### Illustrative Context\n_**Four** plus one is five._\n\n##### Target Sense\n* The default numeral four, as used when referring to inanimate objects. \n* Avoid the noun form for a group of four, e.g. _foursome_, _quartet_, or for a ‘number four’ (e.g. a bus).\n* Avoid any different terms used specifically when referring to humans or other animates. \n* Avoid terms specific to counting up or down, if different, e.g. in Irish, or in Russian where the lexeme for IE CoR [one](../wiki/Meaning:-one) is _odin_, not _raz_ (used when counting up).\n\n* In some languages, the same word root for the numeral four can take different grammatical forms.  \n    * In languages that have gender, give the common or masculine form.\n    * In languages that have a contrasting emphatic form, avoid this and give the non-emphatic form.\n\n* See also the target sense definitions for all five lowest numerals covered in IE-CoR:  [one](../wiki/Meaning:-one), [two](../wiki/Meaning:-two), [three](../wiki/Meaning:-three), [four](../wiki/Meaning:-four), [five](../wiki/Meaning:-five)."

Indeed it should be the basic opposite to the term you enter for the IE-CoR comparison meaning [long](https://github.com/lingdb/CoBL-public/wiki/long) -- see also the precise definition for that comparison meaning too.\n* The lexeme selected should be the most generic adjective for a relatively small distance between two points, prototypically the two ends of an object (on its longest dimension, usually perceived of horizontally rather than vertically).  \n* The target sense is *not* that of a short duration in time.  (That may also fall under the scope of the chosen lexeme, as it does in English, but do not choose a term like 'brief' that refers most basically to time rather than size.) \n* The target sense is also *not* that of short in stature.  I.e., do not give the opposite of 'tall', but the opposite of 'long'.\n* Some languages may have different lexemes depending on the type or form of referent:  rope, clothing, hair, snake/worm, and so on.  In such cases, the prototypical referent to consider is a long and thin object like a piece of rope or string.  As per standard policy, however, please give not a specific lexeme exclusive to that sense, but the lexeme with most basic, broadest range that also includes that prototypical context.\n\n"

57,fog,,249,FOG,"Water droplets or, rarely, ice crystals suspended in the air in sufficient concentration to reduce visibility appreciably.","##### Illustrative Context\n_I couldn't see the village because of the **fog**._\n\n##### Target Sense\n* The most generic term for the equivalent of _cloud_, but at ground-level, and dense enough that it cannot be seen through.  Contrast with the meaning definition for the separate IE-CoR meaning [cloud](../wiki/Meaning:-cloud).  \n* If, like English, a language distinguishes denser _fog_ (that cannot be seen through at all) from thinner _mist_ (that does nonetheless allow even large but distant shapes to be made out), then select the term for denser _fog_.\n* Natural fog, not necessarily caused by pollution:  avoid words specific to that sense, e.g. _smog_. \n* In many languages, like English, the same generic term may be applicable both to fog on land and to ‘fog’ banks out at sea, or rolling onshore from the sea.  Do not, however, select a lexeme that uniquely or predominantly refers to sea fog.\n* In some languages there may not be a basic word specifically for (ground) fog, especially in regions where fog is very rare, or in mountainous regions where the distinction between _cloud_ and _fog_ can seem less rigid.  In such cases, provide the basic term that speakers would nonetheless use to describe fog if encountered elsewhere.  If such a description would be a compound or paraphrase, then select the lexeme within it bearing the most specific meaning closest to _fog_, e.g. the lexeme for _cloud_ in an expression such as _ground cloud_.  In this case, the term selected may be the same as for the separate IE-CoR meaning [cloud](../wiki/Meaning:-cloud)."
18,chest,The part of the body between shoulders and stomach.  *Not* specifically the female breast.,1592,CHEST,The portion of the body from the base of the neck to the top of the abdomen; the thorax.,"##### Illustrative Context\n_His wore a medal on his **chest**._\n\n##### Target Sense\n* The part of the human body between the shoulders and the diaphragm/upper belly (as seen from the front side, but also referring to within the rib-cage, not just in front of it — see below).  \n* Effectively this corresponds to the thorax in medical terminology, but following IE-CoR policy, certainly do not select such technical medical terms. Follow the basic, default register instead, i.e. English _chest_, definitely not _thorax_.\n* Provide the general term for this part of the body, that can be applied to both males and females, both children and adults. Certainly do not select a lexeme that refers only, or predominantly, to the female breasts.  The English lexeme for this target sense is therefore _chest_ (not _breast_ — see also below), in French _poitrine_ (not _sein_), and in Spanish _pecho_ (not _seno_).  Only if a language has no common term, select the word for _male_ chest.  \n* Also avoid figurative uses, senses such as English _bosom_, and euphemistic ones.\n* The term selected should be general _also_ in being able to refer to the part of the body _within_ the rib cage, not just in front of it.  Again, _breast_ is thus not the right lexeme in English, since it refers primarily to the part of the body _in front_ of the rib cage, whereas the correct _chest_ can indeed refer to inside the rib cage too, as in _a chest infection_. Likewise in French, the correct word _poitrine_ is used in, for example, _angine de poitrine_. \n* The need for a general term also means that lexemes that apply only to inside the ribs, such as _rib cage_ or _lungs_, are also to be avoided. \n* Do not be confused by the potential ambiguities in English, which has both a common _chest_ word, as well as another term _breast_. They are only part-synonmous, in that _breast_ can be applied to males or females, but is also ambiguous, because in context it can also have the specific sense of the female breast, and indeed can be used in the plural. Modern usage is tending towards _chest_ as the more general term. In this general sense, _breast_ is becoming dated for many speakers.  It remains in some fixed collocations (e.g. _breast stroke_ in swimming), but otherwise is increasingly reserved as specific to females. (It would sound odd to say _he was punched in the breast_, for example. And while both sexes can suffer _chest pain_, the expression _breast pain_ would normally be taken as referring to a woman only.)\n\n\n"

(That may also fall under the scope of the chosen lexeme, as it does in English, but do not choose a lexeme like 'lengthy' or 'prolonged' that refers most basically to time rather than size.) \n* The target sense is also *not* that of tall in stature.

In English, _hot_ is more in line with the target, and slightly commoner than _warm_, which has a slightly narrower, more specific sense of ‘not especially hot’.  In German, _warm_ is slightly commoner than _heiß_, which has a slightly narrower, more specific sense of ‘particularly hot’.  In a proportion of cases, centered on our target sense, the translational equivalent of English _hot_ is actually often German _warm_.\n\n##### References\n* On the contrasts of tactile vs. ambient in the languages of Vanuatu and in Japanese, see François (2015).  \n* On the contrasts of tactile vs. ambient vs. personal, see Koptjeskaja-Tamm (2011)."

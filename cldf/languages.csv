Although linguistically Magahi is different from Hindi (it does not even belong to same sub-family,
as is clear from the Grierson's classification), the Indian government classifies Magahi as a dialect of Hindi. Despite this attitude, a large population (counting up to 13,978,565 according to the Census of India, 2001) residing in villages and small towns still speak and use the language as
their medium of communication and information-sharing (Alok et al 2011).",,Indic;;;,B0171F,Magahi,false,false
